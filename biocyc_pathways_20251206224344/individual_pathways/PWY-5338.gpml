  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General Information:&lt;/b&gt; Plants containing cyclitols often produce, in addition to RFOs (raffinose , stachyose, etc; see |FRAME:PWY-5342|), non-reducing galactosylcyclitols. These compounds are often found in seeds of many legumes (lentil, chickpea and soybean |CITS:[quemener83][horbowicz94]|). Like RFOs, these soluble galactosylcyclitols are thought to be involved in carbohydrate storage, dessication tolerance and seed viability. The occurrence of methylated inositol galactosides appears to be limited to seeds |CITS:[9576785]|. &lt;b&gt;Enzymes of the pathway:&lt;/b&gt; The compounds can be synthesized by the same enzymes involved in |FRAME:PWY-5337| and |FRAME:PWY-5342| |CITS:[9576785]|.</Description>

      <Comment>A stachyose synthase (STS) was purified to homogeneity (619-fold) from developing seeds of pea (&lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&lt;/i&gt;) |CITS:[11675396]|. The protein cross-reacted with polyclonal antibodies raised against the Adzuki bean |FRAME:MONOMER-12482|. In addition to its stachyose synthase activity, the protein was consistently associated with verbascose synthase activity throughout the purification procedure. Several substrates were tested with the purified enzyme, of which |FRAME:CPD-1099|, |FRAME:CPD-170|, |FRAME:CPD-8046|, |FRAME:4-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL|, and |FRAME:5-O-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL| were effectively utilized. |FRAME:CPD-8058|, the galactosylated product of D-ononitol could in turn be used as galactosyl donor in the reaction when raffinose and stachyose were used as acceptor substrates |CITS:[11675396]|. Interestingly, the incubation of |FRAME:CPD-8065| and |FRAME:CPD-458| led to the formation of a compound which was postulated, based on its retention time, to be |FRAME:CPD-8066|, although the lack of standard prevented the confirmation of this hypothesis. It was also shown that the enzyme could hydrolyze terminal galactose residues from its substrate, albeit at a rate less efficient than that of the galactosyltransferase reaction. Incidentally, the enzyme was unable to transfer galactose to sucrose. In a subsequent report, the gene encoding the STS enzyme was cloned and recombinantly expressed in insect cells |CITS:[PETERBAUER03]|.

      <Comment>A stachyose synthase was purified to homogeneity (244-fold) from mature seeds of Adzuki bean (&lt;i&gt;Vigna angularis&lt;/i&gt;) |CITS:[9576785]|. Following size-exclusion chromatography, two peaks were detected: a minor peak of native 283 kDa and a major peak of 110 kDa. On SDS-PAGE gels, both peaks were resolved to a 90.1 kDa band |CITS:[9576785]|. The enzyme was shown to use a variety of substrates in the presence of |FRAME:CPD-458| as galactosyl donor: |FRAME:CPD-1099|, |FRAME:4-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL|, and |FRAME:5-O-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL|. Additionally, |FRAME:CPD-8050|, |FRAME:CPD-8063| and |FRAME:CPD-8059| were also shown to act as substrates for the reaction albeit less effectively. The naturally-occuring |FRAME:CPD-8046| was only accepted at very low rates |CITS:[9576785]|. |FRAME:MYO-INOSITOL| was shown to be the most effective galactosyl acceptor. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol derivatives modified at position C-1or C-3 did not act as galactosyl acceptors: |FRAME:SUCROSE|, |FRAME:CPD-170|, |FRAME:CPD-8055| ,|FRAME:1-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL|, |FRAME:CPD-8052|, |FRAME:CPD-8055|, |FRAME:CPD-8056|, |FRAME:CPD-8054| and |FRAME:CPD-8064| did not serve as substrates. N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein revealed a single sequence of 24 amino acids: NDPVNATLGLEPSEKVFDLLDGKL |CITS:[9576785]|. The cDNA encoding the aforementioned enzyme was isolated |CITS:[10652123]|. The cDNA was heterologously expressed in insect cell and was shown to encode an enzyme, the activity of which, when tested from crude extracts, were similar to that of the purified enzyme previously reported.

      <Comment>A stachyose synthase was purified to homogeneity (313-fold) from mature seeds of lentil (&lt;i&gt;Lens culinaris&lt;/i&gt;) |CITS:[10334866]|. Following purification to homogeneity, the protein was shown to have a native mass of 99 kDa (determined by size-exclusion chromatography), whilst the denatured mass was assessed at 88.6 kDa (SDS-PAGE) |CITS:[10334866]|. The protein was therefore speculated to be monomeric. The enzyme was shown to use a variety of substrates in the presence of |FRAME:CPD-458| as galactosyl donor: |FRAME:4-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL|, |FRAME:CPD-1099|, |FRAME:CPD-8046| and |FRAME:CPD-8047|. Additionally, |FRAME:5-O-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL| and |FRAME:CPD-8050| were also shown to act as substrates for the reaction but the nature of the products catalyzed remained elusive. Furthermore, |FRAME:SUCROSE|, |FRAME:CPD-170|, |FRAME:CPD-8055| ,|FRAME:1-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL|, |FRAME:CPD-8051|, |FRAME:CPD-8056|, and |FRAME:CPD-8054| did not serve as substrates.</Comment>

      <Comment>A raffinose synthase (RFS) was partially purified from maturing seeds of pea (&lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&lt;/i&gt;) |CITS:[12244450]|; the gene encoding this protein was cloned and the protein expressed in a baculovirus expression system. The enzyme was tested both in its non-purified form (from the crude extract of baculovirus-infected insect cells) and in its partially-purified form: the same activity was demonstrated in both systems. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of raffinose from sucrose and galactinol. In addition to galactinol, the enzyme was able to use galactosylononitol; and sucrose could be replaced by D-ononitol or D-pinitol. In the latter case, the authors of the study did not specify whether the product of the reaction was |FRAME:CPD-8047|, |FRAME:CPD-8048| or a mixture of both |CITS:[12244450]|. Raffinose itself could not be used as an acceptor.</Comment>

      <Comment>|FRAME: CPD-8046| is a methylated cyclitol that plays an important role in osmoregulation and osmoprotection. It has been found in bacteria, fungi, algae and plants. In the salt-tolerant plant |FRAME: TAX-3544| (common ice plant), |FRAME: CPD-8046| can accumulate to up to 70% of total soluble carbohydrate, or 10% of plant dry weight under water stress conditions. In salt-tolerant plants |FRAME: CPD-8046| is located in the cytosol and chloroplasts. In angiosperms, D-pinitol biosynthesis proceeds via |FRAME: 4-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL| (1D-4-O-methyl myo-inositol) |CITS: [1600940]|, whereas in gymnosperms, it proceeds via |FRAME: 5-O-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL| (1D-5-O-methyl myo-inositol) |CITS: [Dittrich72]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6739|).</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: Inositols Inositol| is the generic name for 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers. Among the isomers, |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| is the most abundant in nature and it is an essential compound in eukaryotic cell membranes as a phosphatidylinositol moiety, which plays an important role in signal transduction. Some other forms, such as |FRAME: CPD-8050|, are also found in nature, although they are less abundant. Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering. Additional information on the nomenclature of &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf&quot;&gt;Nomenclature of cyclitols&lt;/A&gt; by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html&quot;&gt;Numbering of atoms in &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol&lt;/A&gt;, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication. To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN &quot;EC 2.7.1.64&quot;|).</Comment>
