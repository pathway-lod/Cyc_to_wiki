```

### Input Files

Place all PlantCyc `.dat` files in a directory.

### Output

- **Individual pathway files**: `[output_dir]/biocyc_pathways_[timestamp]/individual_pathways/*.gpml`
- **Single reaction files** (if `--include-reactions`): `individual_reactions/*.gpml`
- **Build summary**: `BUILD_SUMMARY.txt`

## How It Works: Pathway Building Methodology

The converter follows a bottom-up data collection approach, starting from a pathway ID and recursively gathering all related components.

### High-Level Process

```
Pathway ID
    ↓
1. Retrieve Pathway Record & Expand Sub-Pathways
    ↓
2. Collect Reactions from Expanded List
    ↓
3. Retrieve Compounds from Reactions
    ↓
4. Retrieve Proteins/Enzymes that Catalyze Reactions
    ↓
5. Retrieve Genes that Encode Proteins
    ↓
6. Retrieve Regulations for Reactions
    ↓
7. Collect Primary Compound Information (REACTION-LAYOUT)
    ↓
8. Calculate Positions for All Components
    ↓
9. Create DataNodes (Genes, Proteins, Compounds)
    ↓
10. Create Interactions (Gene→Protein, Protein→Reaction, Compound↔Reaction, Regulator→Reaction)
    ↓
11. Gather Citations for All Elements
    ↓
GPML Pathway (XML)
```

### Steps Explained

#### 1. Pathway Expansion and Sub-Pathways

BioCyc pathways can reference other pathways in their `REACTION-LIST` field. The converter recursively expands these references to get the complete set of reactions.

**Example**:
```
ARGDEGRAD-PWY has REACTION-LIST: [ARGININE-DEIMINASE-RXN, CITRULLINE-DEG-PWY]
                                                              ↓ (sub-pathway)
CITRULLINE-DEG-PWY has REACTION-LIST: [RXN0-5222, RXN-14196, ORNCARBAMTRANSFER-RXN]

Final expanded list: [ARGININE-DEIMINASE-RXN, RXN0-5222, RXN-14196, ORNCARBAMTRANSFER-RXN]
```

#### 2. Entity Collection (Compounds, Proteins, Genes)

From the expanded reaction list, the converter collects:
- **Compounds**: All reactants and products from reaction equations
- **Proteins/Enzymes**: All catalysts from `enzrxns.dat` (bridge between proteins and reactions)
- **Genes**: All genes that encode proteins (from `PRODUCT` field in genes.dat)


#### 3. Regulation Collection

Regulations specify how compounds or proteins **activate or inhibit** reactions. The converter:
- Parses `regulation.dat` to find regulations targeting pathway reactions
- Determines regulation mode: `+` (activation) → Stimulation arrow, `-` (inhibition) → Inhibition arrow
- Adds regulators to the pathway, even if they weren't part of the reaction flow

#### 4. Primary Compound Information (REACTION-LAYOUT)

BioCyc provides layout hints in the `REACTION-LAYOUT` field to indicate which compounds are the "main" reactants/products for visualization.

**Format**:
```
(RXN-ID (:LEFT-PRIMARIES CPD1 CPD2) (:DIRECTION :L2R) (:RIGHT-PRIMARIES CPD3))
```

- `LEFT-PRIMARIES`: Compounds on the left side of the chemical equation (typically reactants)
- `RIGHT-PRIMARIES`: Compounds on the right side of the chemical equation (typically products)
- `DIRECTION`: `:L2R` (left-to-right) or `:R2L` (right-to-left) - indicates **physiological flow direction**

**Important Design Choice**: The `:DIRECTION` field controls which way the arrow points but does NOT change the underlying chemical equation.

- **L2R (left-to-right)**: Arrow points from LEFT-PRIMARIES → RIGHT-PRIMARIES (normal flow)
- **R2L (right-to-left)**: Arrow points from RIGHT-PRIMARIES → LEFT-PRIMARIES (reversed physiological flow)

**Technical Implementation**: When `DIRECTION` is `:R2L`, the converter:
1. Sets arrow start to RIGHT-PRIMARIES (products become visual start)
2. Sets arrow end to LEFT-PRIMARIES (reactants become visual end)
3. Searches for arrow start compounds in BOTH products and reactants lists (critical for R2L)
4. Searches for arrow end compounds in BOTH reactants and products lists (critical for R2L)


**Visual**:
```
Direction :L2R (normal)
FRUCTOSE-1,6-BP ────────○────────> GAP + DHAP
   (reactant)                     (products)
   Arrow flows left → right

Direction :R2L (reversed physiological flow)
FRUCTOSE-1,6-BP <──────○──────── GAP + DHAP
   (reactant)                     (products)
   Arrow flows right → left (reversed to show physiological direction)
```

**Search Strategy**: The converter searches for `REACTION-LAYOUT` across all pathway records, This handles cases where sub-pathways have more  layout information than parent pathways.

#### 5. Layout Calculation

The converter supports two layout algorithms, configurable via `--layout` option:

##### 5a. Grid Layout (Default)

A three-layer hierarchical grid layout organizes entities by type:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 1: GENES (top)                   │
│  Grid: 3+ columns, 120px spacing        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓ 80px padding
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 2: PROTEINS (middle)             │
│  Grid: 3+ columns, 150px spacing        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓ 80px padding
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 3: COMPOUNDS (bottom)            │
│  Grid: 3+ columns, 150px spacing        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pros**: Fast, predictable, hierarchical view of gene→protein→compound flow
**Cons**: May have more edge crossings in complex pathways

##### 5b. ForceAtlas2 Layout

Force-directed graph layout that automatically positions nodes to minimize edge crossings and overlap. using NetworkX module




#### 6. Interaction Creation

The converter creates four types of interactions:

**A. Gene → Protein** (Transcription/Translation)
- Arrow from gene to protein with `TranscriptionTranslation` arrow head
- Connects to all monomers if protein is a complex

**B. Protein → Reaction** (Catalysis)
- Uses a **central anchor pattern**:
```
Main Reactant ────────○──────── Main Product
                      │
                   Enzyme
```
- Main reactant/product on the main line (from `REACTION-LAYOUT`)
- Additional reactants/products connect to anchor
- Enzyme connects to anchor from top with `Catalysis` arrow head

**C. Compound ↔ Reaction** (Conversion)
- Additional reactants: compound → anchor (no arrow)
- Additional products: anchor → compound (with `Conversion` arrow head)

**D. Regulator → Reaction** (Regulation)
- Arrow from regulator to reaction anchor
- Arrow type based on mode: `Stimulation` (+) or `Inhibition` (-)

#### 7. Citation Management

The converter extracts citations from:
- `CITATIONS` field in records
- Inline citations in `COMMENT` fields (e.g., `|CITS: [12345]|`)

**Citation Priority** (in order of preference):
1. **PubMed ID** → Creates `<Xref dataSource="pubmed" identifier="12345678" />`
   - Standard database identifier that PathVisio/WikiPathways can use to link to PubMed
2**BioCyc ID** → Creates `<Xref dataSource="BioCyc" identifier="UNIQUE-ID | Title (Authors, Year)" />` with full bibliographic information:
   - Format: `"UNIQUE-ID | Title (Author1, Author2 et al., Year)"`
   - Includes title (truncated to 100 chars), first 3 authors, and year
   - Why: Provides human-readable citation text when PubMed/DOI unavailable - users can copy and search manually and later lookup might be possible
