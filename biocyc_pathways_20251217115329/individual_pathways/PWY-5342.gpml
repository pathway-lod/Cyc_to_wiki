  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General Information:&lt;/b&gt; verbascose and ajugose are two members of the so-called &apos;raffinose series&apos; of sucrosyl oligosaccharides (also known as raffinose family oligosaccharides, RFOs). Sucrosyl oligosaccharides represent a large portion of primary oligosaccharides in plants (defined as oligosaccharides synthesized by the action of a glycosyl transferase that mediates the transfer of a glycopyranosyl residue to either the glucopyranosyl or fructofuranosyl moiety of sucrose. They are differentiated from secondary oligosaccharides which are generated by the hydrolysis of higher oligosaccharides, polysaccharides or heterosides. For review, see |CITS:[KANDLER82]|). Members of the raffinose series occur at least in traces in each plant family; it is one of the most widespread sucrosyl oligosaccharide series in flowering plants and might even be ubiquitous (see |CITS:[KANDLER82]| for review). This series comprises |FRAME:CPD-1099|, |FRAME:CPD-170|, |FRAME:CPD-8065|,|FRAME:CPD-8066| as well as several other compounds with a higher degree of polymerization (DP; the highest is a nonasaccharide; none of these higher-DP oligosaccharides in the series have not yet been named). The sugars of this series consist of &amp;alpha;1,6-linked chains of D-galactose attached to the 6-glucosyl position of sucrose. They are synthesized in leaves, roots and tubers. Raffinose and stachyose are the two most commonly found oligosaccharides of this series (see |FRAME:PWY-5337|). However, higher RFOs with DP are also found in certain species such as the frost-hardy &lt;i&gt;Ajuga reptans&lt;/i&gt;, in which both short-chain and long-chain RFOs are present and have been speculated to act as antifreeze or antisalt agents |CITS:[12232288],[12228647],[12223871],[10758476]|. The biosynthesis of higher-DP RFOs appears to occurs via two routes: one is dependent on galactinol, and requires enzymes similar to that of the |FRAME:PWY-5337| pathway (this pathway), the other does not appear to require galactinol (see |FRAME:PWY-5343|). &lt;b&gt;Enzymes of the pathway:&lt;/b&gt; A single enzyme has been described that can catalyze both polymerization steps of this pathway. This enzyme, galactinol:raffinose galactosyltransferase, catalyzes the chain elongation of RFOs by transferring the &amp;alpha;-galactosyl residue of galactinol to RFO molecules. The enzyme appears to be primarily a stachyose synthase catalyzing the galactosylation of raffinose into stachyose. However, it was shown to also use stachyose and verbascose as substrates. &lt;b&gt;General Information:&lt;/b&gt; Verbascose and ajugose are two members of the so-called &apos;raffinose series&apos; of sucrosyl oligosaccharides (also known as raffinose family oligosaccharides, RFOs).

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">This protein has sequence similarities with other raffinose synthases (EC 3.4.1.82), however a mutant with a T-DNA insertion in the gene coding for this protein was shown to have its levels of verbascose decreased (along with mannitol and sucrose) whereas raffinose and stachyose levels were normal. This observation led the authors to speculate that the enzyme might, in fact, catalyze the formation of verbascose |CITS:[anderson01]|.</Comment>

      <Comment>A stachyose synthase (STS) was purified to homogeneity (619-fold) from developing seeds of pea (&lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&lt;/i&gt;) |CITS:[11675396]|. The protein cross-reacted with polyclonal antibodies raised against the Adzuki bean |FRAME:MONOMER-12482|. In addition to its stachyose synthase activity, the protein was consistently associated with verbascose synthase activity throughout the purification procedure. Several substrates were tested with the purified enzyme, of which |FRAME:CPD-1099|, |FRAME:CPD-170|, |FRAME:CPD-8046|, |FRAME:4-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL|, and |FRAME:5-O-METHYL-MYO-INOSITOL| were effectively utilized. |FRAME:CPD-8058|, the galactosylated product of D-ononitol could in turn be used as galactosyl donor in the reaction when raffinose and stachyose were used as acceptor substrates |CITS:[11675396]|. Interestingly, the incubation of |FRAME:CPD-8065| and |FRAME:CPD-458| led to the formation of a compound which was postulated, based on its retention time, to be |FRAME:CPD-8066|, although the lack of standard prevented the confirmation of this hypothesis. It was also shown that the enzyme could hydrolyze terminal galactose residues from its substrate, albeit at a rate less efficient than that of the galactosyltransferase reaction. Incidentally, the enzyme was unable to transfer galactose to sucrose. In a subsequent report, the gene encoding the STS enzyme was cloned and recombinantly expressed in insect cells |CITS:[PETERBAUER03]|.

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: Inositols Inositol| is the generic name for 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers. Among the isomers, |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| is the most abundant in nature and it is an essential compound in eukaryotic cell membranes as a phosphatidylinositol moiety, which plays an important role in signal transduction. Some other forms, such as |FRAME: CPD-8050|, are also found in nature, although they are less abundant. Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering. Additional information on the nomenclature of &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf&quot;&gt;Nomenclature of cyclitols&lt;/A&gt; by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html&quot;&gt;Numbering of atoms in &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol&lt;/A&gt;, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication. To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN &quot;EC 2.7.1.64&quot;|).</Comment>
