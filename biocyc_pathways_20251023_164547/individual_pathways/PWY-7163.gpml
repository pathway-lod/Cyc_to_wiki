  <Description>Although polymethylated kaempferols have not been found in trichomes of wild and cultivated tomatoes their widespread occurrence in the plant kingdom is well documented |CITS:[11130659]|. Nevertheless, apart from the tomato secretory (type 1/4) and storage (type 6) glands various |FRAME:CPD1F-90 kaempferol| metabolites have been detected in other parts of tomatoes as well |CITS:[16896233]| |CITS:[21343428]|. |FRAME:CPD1F-90 Kaempferol| and its numerous derivatives are present in many edible or medicinal plants being appreciated for their positive impact on long term health in humans due to their valuable pharmacological properties |CITS:[21428901]|. In addition, flavonols such as |FRAME:CPD1F-90 kaempferol| and derivatives play important roles in the biology of plants, for example during various developmental stages (pollen germination) |CITS:[12083465]| |CITS:[10567367]| or in plant defense |CITS:[11314958]|. This pathway displays the catalytic breadth by which three myricetin &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferases (MOMT&apos;s) isolated and characterized from |FRAME:TAX-62890 &lt;i&gt;Solanum habrochaites&lt;/i&gt;| and |FRAME:TAX-4081 &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;| |CITS:[21343428]| |CITS:[22711283]| utilize other substrates than |FRAME:MYRICETIN myricetin| (see |FRAME:PWY-7160 polymethylated myricetin biosynthesis (tomato)|), i.e. |FRAME:CPD1F-90 kaempferol| catalyzing the formation of polymethylated kaempferols (compare also |FRAME:PWY-7161 polymethylated quercetin biosynthesis|). The three identified MOMT&apos;s were cloned and expressed in |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| to determine their molecular function. MOMT1 assigned as 3&apos;/5&apos;-methyltransferase did not react with |FRAME:CPD1F-90 kaempferol| as it requires hydroxyl groups in 3&apos; or 5&apos;-position for activity. MOMT2, designated as 7/4&apos;-methyltransferase either methylated the 7-position of |FRAME:CPD-7252 kaempferide| with high relative activity to form |FRAME:CPD-14951 7,4&apos;-dimethylkaempferol| or the 4&apos;-position of |FRAME:CPD1F-90 kaempferol| to yield |FRAME:CPD-7252 kaempferide| with equally high activity |CITS:[21343428]|. MOMT3 characterized from both |FRAME:TAX-62890 &lt;i&gt;Solanum habrochaites&lt;/i&gt;| and |FRAME:TAX-4081 &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;| was dubbed as 3-methyltransferase. MOMT3 catalyzed the formation of |FRAME:CPD-14950 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylkaempferol| and |FRAME:CPD-14952 3,4&apos;-dimethylkaempferol| with likewise high efficiency |CITS:[22711283]|. From tissues of |FRAME:TAX-3570 &lt;i&gt;Dianthus caryophyllus&lt;/i&gt;| a very specific 4&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase was characterized which only worked with flavonoids having a sole hydroxyl group in the 4&apos;-position of the B-ring. Consequently |FRAME:CPD1F-90 kaempferol| turned out to be the best substrate for the |FRAME:TAX-3569 &lt;i&gt;Dianthus&lt;/i&gt;| 4&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase which is probably involved in a phytoalexin pathway producing |FRAME:CPD-14960 kaempferide triglycoside| |CITS:[12899699]|.</Description>

      <Comment source="O-28, hartmut">The genome sequence of |FRAME:TAX-4081 &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;| was used to identify a homolog of MOMT1 previously identified and characterized from |FRAME:TAX-62890 &lt;i&gt;Solanum habrochaites&lt;/i&gt;|. The homolog of |FRAME:TAX-4081 &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;|, designed as MOMT3 was located on chromosome 6 and had a sequence identity with MOMT1 from |FRAME:TAX-62890 &lt;i&gt;Solanum habrochaites&lt;/i&gt;| of 87%. The cDNA encoding the methyltransferase MOMT3 was expressed in |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| and shown to methylate |FRAME:MYRICETIN myricetin| and derivatives thereof with high position-specificity at position 3. Consequently, the first committed step in the |FRAME:PWY-7160 polymethylated myricetin biosynthesis (tomato)|, i.e. the formation of |FRAME:CPD-14930 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylmyricetin| was carried out by MOMT3. With comparable high efficiency |FRAME:CPD-14939 3,3&apos;-dimethylmyricetin| and |FRAME:CPD-14938 3,3&apos;,5&apos;-trimethylmyricetin| was catalyzed from their immediate precursors |FRAME:CPD-8605 laricitrin| and |FRAME:SYRINGETIN syringetin|, respectively. The formation of |FRAME:CPD-14941 3,3&apos;,4&apos;,5&apos;-tetramethylmyricetin| from |FRAME:CPD-14936 3&apos;,4&apos;,5&apos;-trimethylmyricetin| was also catalyzed though with lower turnover efficiency. |FRAME:CPD-520 Quercetin| and derivatives could also be used and methylated in the 3-position of the A-ring. MOMT3 methylated |FRAME:CPD-520 quercetin| yielding |FRAME:3457-TETRAHYDROXY-3-METHOXYFLAVONE 3-O-methylquercetin| and used the substrates |FRAME:CPD-8004 isorhamnetin| and |FRAME:CPD-13511 rhamnetin| with comparable high efficiency to form |FRAME:CPD-14946 3,3&apos;-dimethylquercetin| and |FRAME:345-TRIHYDROXY-37-DIMETHOXYFLAVONE 3,7-dimethylquercetin|. |FRAME:CPD1F-90 Kaempferol| was utilized to form |FRAME:CPD-14950 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylkaempferol| with the same catalyztic efficiency as the other non-methylated flavonols |FRAME:MYRICETIN myricetin| and |FRAME:CPD-520 quercetin|. In addition, MOMT3 methylated the 3-position of |FRAME:CPD-7252 kaempferide| yielding |FRAME:CPD-14952 3,4&apos;-dimethylkaempferol| |CITS:[22711283]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="O-28, hartmut">Utilizing a bioinformatics approach by screening a trichome EST library from secreting and storage glands of |FRAME:TAX-62890 &lt;i&gt;Solanum habrochaites&lt;/i&gt;| a flavonol 7/4&apos;-methyltransferase (MOMT2) was identified and biochemically characterized. The cDNA encoding the flavonol 7/4&apos;-methyltransferase was expressed in |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;|, purified to near homogeneity and its catalytic data obtained in assays with a collection of non-methylated and partially methylated flavonols. MOMT2 was able to methylate the 7-position of |FRAME:MYRICETIN myricetin| to form |FRAME:CPD-14933 7-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylmyricetin| The utilization of |FRAME:CPD-14930 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylmyricetin| to yield the important intermediate |FRAME:CPD-14942 3,7-dimethylmyricetin| could not be tested as the compound was not available. However MOMT2 accepted |FRAME:3457-TETRAHYDROXY-3-METHOXYFLAVONE 3-O-methylquercetin| generating |FRAME:345-TRIHYDROXY-37-DIMETHOXYFLAVONE 3,7-dimethylquercetin| which indicates the catalytic capability to also catalyze the formation of |FRAME:CPD-14942 3,7-dimethylmyricetin|. With less efficiency MOMT2 catalyzed the formation of |FRAME:CPD-14935 3&apos;,4&apos;-dimethylmyricetin|, |FRAME:CPD-14937 7,3&apos;,4&apos;,5&apos;-tetramethylmyricetin| and |FRAME:CPD-14940 7,3&apos;,5&apos;-trimethylmyricetin| when the corresponding precursors |FRAME:CPD-8605 laricitrin|, |FRAME:CPD-14936 3&apos;,4&apos;,5&apos;-trimethylmyricetin| and |FRAME:SYRINGETIN syringetin| were used in the assays. In the |FRAME:CPD-520 quercetin| series of potential substrates MOMT2 also catalyzed the 7-position of |FRAME:CPD-520 quercetin| yielding |FRAME:CPD-13511 rhamnetin|. With comparable high efficiency the formation of |FRAME:CPD-14948 7,4&apos;-dimethylquercetin| from |FRAME:CPD-13511 rhamnetin| was carried out. With lower catalytic efficiency |FRAME:CPD-8004 isorhamnetin| was methylated at the 4&apos;-position to yield |FRAME:CPD-14949 3&apos;,4&apos;-dimethylquercetin|. When |FRAME:CPD1F-90 kaempferol| was used as substrate the 4&apos;-position on the C-ring was methylated forming |FRAME:CPD-7252 kaempferide| which was then further methylated at the 7-position (A-ring) to form |FRAME:CPD-14951 7,4&apos;-dimethylkaempferol|. The overall lower &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; turnover rates of MOMT2 compared to MOMT1 was discussed as an indication for a possible rate limiting function of OMT2 in the pathway. According to this methylation pattern MOMT2 was classified as 7/4&apos;-methyltransferase. The flavonol 7/4&apos;-methyltransferase was active without Mg2+ or Mn2+. MOMT2 was only found in trichomes of |FRAME:TAX-62890 &lt;i&gt;Solanum habrochaites&lt;/i&gt;| and was 2 to 4 fold higher expressed in secreting glands (type 1/4 glands) than in storage glands (type 6 glands) |CITS:[21343428]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="O-28, hartmut">A &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase activity which specifically &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylated the 4&apos;-position (B-ring) of flavonoids was identified, purified to homogeneity and characterized from tissues of |FRAME:TAX-3570 &lt;i&gt;Dianthus caryophyllus&lt;/i&gt;|. The activity of the flavonoid 4&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase was inducible and increased significantly after tissue inoculation with the phytopathogenic fungus |FRAME:TAX-5507 &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt;| f. sp. Dianthi (Fod). The 4&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase did not act on hydroxybenzoic acids and hydroxycinnamic acids and also showed no activity with flavonoid substrates having an contiguous hydroxyl group next to the hydroxylated 4&apos;-position such as |FRAME:CPD-520 quercetin|. The best &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; substrate for the flavonoid 4&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase was |FRAME:CPD1F-90 kaempferol| yielding |FRAME:CPD-7252 kaempferide| followed by |FRAME:CPD-431 apigenin| producing |FRAME:CPD-1095 acacetin|. With considerably lower efficiency |FRAME:CPD-3141 genistein| was accepted as substrate forming |FRAME:BIOCHANIN-A biochanin-A|. However, the unusual activity of an OMT with isoflavones and the observed methylation at the 4&apos;-position of polyglycosylated derivatives of |FRAME:CPD1F-90 kaempferol| emphasizes the importance of the sole hydroxyl group at 4&apos; for substrate recognition and binding. The enzyme reaction was characterized as a bi-substrate reaction indicating a Ping-Pong mechanism. The enzyme was proposed to be involved in plant defense rather than playing a structural role as it catalyzes |FRAME:CPD-7252 kaempferide| an precursor of the |FRAME:TAX-3569 &lt;i&gt;Dianthus&lt;/i&gt;| phytoalexin |FRAME:CPD-14960 kaempferide triglycoside| |CITS:[12899699]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (AdoMet, SAM) is a sulfonium compound in which each of the carbons attached to the sulfur is activated toward nucleophilic attack. It is the most common methyl group donor for methyltransferase enzymes. In addition, AdoMet is cleaved reductively by a large number of iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes (known as radical SAM or radical AdoMet enzymes) to produce |FRAME: CPD-15400|, which they use to activate their substrates. Another major role of AdoMet is in polyamine biosynthesis, where it is decarboxylated by |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.50|, to form |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE|, which serves as a propylamine group donor. AdoMet is formed by |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.6| and bears an &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; configuration at the sulfur atom. The chiral sulfonium of AdoMet spontaneously racemizes under physiological conditions to form a mixture of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; isomers. This results in reduced activity, as the |FRAME: CPD0-2554 &quot;&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; isomer&quot;| is not accepted as a substrate for AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases |CITS: [12419350]|.</Comment>
