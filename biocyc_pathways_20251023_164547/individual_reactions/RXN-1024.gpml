      <Comment>|FRAME:Fatty-Aldehydes &quot;Fatty aldehydes&quot;| are aldehydes that are formed by the reduction of the carboxylic acid group of |FRAME: Fatty-Acids fatty acids|. Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs &quot;fatty acyl-CoAs&quot;|, |FRAME: Fatty-Alcohols alcohols|, and |FRAME: Fatty-Aldehydes aldehydes|, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined: |FRAME: Short-Chain-Aldehydes &quot;Short-chain fatty aldehydes&quot;| are derived from |FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids &quot;fatty acids that have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain&quot;|. |FRAME: Medium-Chain-Aldehydes &quot;Medium-chain fatty aldehydes&quot;| are derived from |FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids &quot;fatty acids that have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain&quot;|. |FRAME: Long-Chain-Aldehydes &quot;Long-chain fatty aldehydes&quot;| are derived from |FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids &quot;fatty acids that have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain&quot;|. |FRAME: Very-Long-Chain-Aldehydes &quot;Very-long-chain fatty aldehydes&quot;| are derived from |FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids &quot;fatty acids that have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain&quot;|. |FRAME: Ultra-Long-Chain-Aldehydes &quot;Ultra-long-chain fatty aldehydes&quot;| are derived from |FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids &quot;fatty acids that have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain&quot;|.</Comment>

      <Comment>A primary alcohol is a compound in which a hydroxy group, -OH, is attached to a saturated carbon atom that is connected to no more than one other carbon atom. Primary alcohols are also classified based on their length. |FRAME: Short-Chain-Primary-Alcohols &quot;Short-chain primary alcohols&quot;| have alkyl chains with fewer than six carbons. |FRAME: Medium-Chain-Primary-Alcohols &quot;Medium-chain primary alcohols&quot;| have alkyl chains of 6-12 carbons. |FRAME: Long-Chain-Primary-Alcohols &quot;Long-chain primary alcohols&quot;| (also known as fatty alcohols) have alkyl chains of 13-22 carbons. |FRAME: Very-Long-Chain-Primary-Alcohols &quot;Very long-chain primary alcohols&quot;| have alkyl chains of 23 carbons or longer.</Comment>

      <Comment>|FRAME: NAD-P-OR-NOP| is a class of compounds including the instances |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2&apos; position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety. These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). They are often referred to as coenzymes, although in most of their reactions they function as cosubstrates rather than true coenzymes. The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form. |FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).</Comment>
