  <Description>&lt;i&gt;Summary from MetaCyc:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt; The nucleotides |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| (guanosine 3&apos;-diphosphate 5&apos;-diphosphate) and |FRAME: GDP-TP pppGpp| (guanosine 3&apos;-diphosphate 5&apos;-triphosphate), referred to collectively as (p)ppGpp, have been shown to regulate gene expression during the stringent response in some bacteria. Their levels become elevated during this response and they are key indicators and regulators of it. The stringent response is a global regulatory system that operates under conditions of nutrient or energy starvation or other environmental stress. It has varying effects on gene expression and metabolism |CITS: [18039766] [18430135]|. In addition to bacteria, there is evidence that (p)ppGpp may regulate transcription by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase in plant chloroplasts |CITS: [19308923]|. Due to its role as an effector molecule in the stringent response in bacteria, (p)ppGpp has been described as a bacterial alarmone. It can contribute to the regulation of various cellular processes that are affected by nutritional stress such as growth, cell division, motility, adaptation and virulence. Its effect on the pathogenicity of some bacteria has led to the development of |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| analogs as possible antibacterial compounds |CITS: [18776539]| and new &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; synthesis |CITS: [18789883]| and detection |CITS: [18166051]| methods for |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp|. Different bacteria have different ways of synthesizing and responding to (p)ppGpp, many of which are still being discovered. Even in the well-studied |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| many details of |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| action remain to be elucidated. Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [15866041] [18359660]|. In the |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| stringent response transcription, translation and DNA replication are affected by (p)ppGpp levels. Transcription is redirected from genes related to growth to genes involved in survival under starvation and stress conditions. The regulation of transcription by (p)ppGpp occurs at the transcription initiation stage and affects promoter use. However, the mechanism remains unclear and direct and indirect models for regulation have been proposed. It has been shown that |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| and a cofactor protein DksA bind to RNA polymerase and modulate its activity at promoters |CITS: [15294157] [15899978]|, although the exact |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| binding site(s) responsible for regulation are undefined |CITS: [18272182]|. Transcription of many &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent genes and genes dependent upon alternative sigma factors is negatively or positively regulated by |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp|. In direct models for regulation, |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| affects the RNA polymerase-promoter interaction via stabilization, or destabilization of the RNA polymerase-promoter open complex. Indirect models include changes in the availability of RNA polymerase, and a role for |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| in regulating differential binding of sigma factors to core RNA polymerase. Transcriptional alterations resulting from these mechanisms include repression of tRNA and rRNA synthesis (a key event in limiting the growth rate), induction of stress response factors, and induction of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport. Reviewed in |CITS: [16554711] [15686546] [18359660]|. In |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| the regulation of translation by (p)ppGpp involves its repression of transcription of rRNA, tRNA and ribosomal proteins, as well as its interaction with initiation factor IF2 and possibly with elongation factors. The regulation of DNA replication by (p)ppGpp in |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| involves inhibition of the initiation step. The demonstration that the |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| DnaG primase is inhibited by |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; also suggests inhibition of the elongation step |CITS: [19945481]|. Reviewed in |CITS: [18359660]|. In |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| the products of genes &lt;i&gt;relA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;spoT&lt;/i&gt; have prominent roles in (p)ppGpp metabolism. This was shown by the absence of |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| in &lt;i&gt;relA&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;spoT&lt;/i&gt; null mutants under stringent conditions |CITS: [2005134]|. RelA functions as a synthetase and SpoT mainly as a hydrolase, although it also has synthetase activity. Regulation of these opposing activities is critical for the ability of bacteria to respond to nutritional stress and to avoid a futile cycle of synthesis and hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp.. Homologous variants of the RelA and SpoT genes encoding Rsh proteins (Rel Spo homologs) are found in some bacteria and plants. The &amp;beta;- and &amp;gamma;-proteobacteria have proteins homologous to RelA and SpoT, while most other bacteria have a bifunctional protein designated Rel. Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629]|. Experiments have shown that regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by RelA in response to amino acid starvation occurs at the level of translation on the ribosome. Ribosome-associated RelA produces |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| in response to the presence of uncharged tRNA in the ribosomal A-site which results in a stalled ribosome. Regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by SpoT is less well understood, but involves sensing other sources of nutrient stress, such as a limitation in fatty acid synthesis |CITS: [17078815]|. SpoT also senses phosphate starvation |CITS: [17640895]| and iron limitation |CITS: [15853883]|. Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [16554711]|. &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt; The pathway shown here for the biosynthesis and metabolism of (p)ppGpp is based upon that shown in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]| (see reference below) except as noted. Early kinetic studies established the overall pathway of |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| metabolism. The first product of the stringent response to amino acid starvation is |FRAME: GDP-TP pppGpp| which is quickly converted to the more stable compound |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp|. |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| is then hydrolyzed to |FRAME: GDP GDP| |CITS: [782536] [321933]|. A role for a kinase in converting |FRAME: ENTEROBACTIN enterobactin| back to |FRAME: GTP GTP| to complete a cycle was proposed early (in |CITS: [321933] [365225]|) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, the product of gene &lt;i&gt;ndk&lt;/i&gt;, was suggested as a likely candidate. This was supported by mutant studies in |FRAME:TAX-28901 &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;| serovar Typhimurium (|FRAME:TAX-90371 &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; enterica serovar Typhimurium|) although there is no direct evidence for a unique effect of Ndk on (p)ppGpp levels in |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| or &lt;i&gt;S. typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below). RelA can catalyze the conversion of both |FRAME: GTP GTP| to |FRAME: GDP-TP pppGpp|, and |FRAME: GDP GDP| to |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| with similar &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; values derived from the Hill equation. These values are well below the intracellular pool concentrations of |FRAME: GTP GTP| and |FRAME: ATP ATP|, but are similar to the intracellular pool concentration of |FRAME: GDP GDP| |CITS: [3015258]|. Therefore |FRAME: GDP-TP pppGpp| is probably the main RelA product, although both reactions are shown here (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below). In addition to a synthetase (PSI) domain, RelA also contains an inactive hydrolase domain (in |CITS: [18454629]|). RelA is responsible for ppGpp synthesis during the stringent response to amino acid starvation. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; |FRAME: GDP-TP pppGpp| is rapidly converted to |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| by Gpp (reviewed in |CITS: [15590778]|). It is the major route of |FRAME: GDP-TP pppGpp| degradation, although minor routes via enzymes with similar activity may also exist (Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below). SpoT is a bifunctional enzyme with both a hydrolase activity and a weak synthetase activity (designated PSII) |CITS: [2005135] [8730877]|. The SpoT |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| hydrolase activity is inhibited under conditions of physiological stress and has a major role in |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| degradation. The role of the SpoT synthetase (PSII) activity is less clear. It has been proposed to have a role in maintaining the basal level of |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP ppGpp| during exponential growth (in |CITS: [8648647]|). SpoT also has pppGpp hydrolase activity |CITS: [365225]| and possibly pppGpp synthetase activity. The putative SpoT |FRAME: GDP-TP pppGpp| synthetase activity is based on mutant phenotype. In &amp;Delta;&lt;i&gt;relA&lt;/i&gt;/&amp;Delta;&lt;i&gt;gpp&lt;/i&gt; mutants starved for glucose |FRAME: GDP-TP pppGpp| accumulates which suggests phosphoryl group transfer to |FRAME: GTP GTP| as well as |FRAME: GDP GDP|, although the phsophoryl donor is not known (cited as unpublished data in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below). This reaction is not shown here. Reviewed in Cashel, M., D.R. Gentry, V. J. Hernandez and D. Vinella (1996) &quot;The Stringent Response&quot;, chapter 92, pp. 1458-1496, in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|.</Description>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">The cDNA encoding nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2 (AtNDK-2) was identified from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and recombinant expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. The molecular function of catalyzing the exchange transfer of a &amp;gamma;-phosphoryl group from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside diphosphate was confirmed with purified recombinant protein and the structure and mode of action demonstrated in the crystallized protein |CITS: [15465053]|. AtNDK-2 has been shown to be involved in the phytochrome mediated growth and developmental processes by interacting with the C-terminal domain of phytochrome A (PhyA) |CITS: [15561724]|. In addition AtNDK-2 takes part in cellular redox regulation by interacting with activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) conferring tolerance to environmental stresses such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation |CITS: [12506203]|. Furthermore, AtNDK-2 has been reported to be involved in auxin-regulated processes, particularly through the mediation of polar auxin transport |CITS: [15927941]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">The most abundant form of the phosphate ion at pH 7.3 is hydrogenphosphate. To simplify the presentation of reactions taking place at physiological pH, MetaCyc does not distinguish between the two forms, and uses the name &quot;phosphate&quot; even though the structure shown is that of hydrogenphosphate.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">The nucleotides |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| (guanosine 3&apos;-diphosphate 5&apos;-diphosphate) and |FRAME: GDP-TP| (guanosine 3&apos;-diphosphate 5&apos;-triphosphate), referred to collectively as (p)ppGpp, have been shown to regulate gene expression during the stringent response in some bacteria. Their levels become elevated during this response and they are key indicators and regulators of it. The stringent response is a global regulatory system that operates under conditions of nutrient or energy starvation or other environmental stress. It has varying effects on gene expression and metabolism. In addition to bacteria, there is evidence that (p)ppGpp may regulate transcription by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase in plant chloroplasts |CITS: [19308923]|. Due to its role as an effector molecule in the stringent response in bacteria, (p)ppGpp has been described as a bacterial alarmone. It can contribute to the regulation of various cellular processes that are affected by nutritional stress such as growth, cell division, motility, adaptation and virulence. Its effect on the pathogenicity of some bacteria has led to the development of ppGpp analogs as possible antibacterial compounds |CITS: [18776539]| and new &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; synthesis |CITS: [18789883]| and detection |CITS: [18166051]| methods for ppGpp. Different bacteria have different ways of synthesizing and responding to (p)ppGpp, many of which are still being discovered. Even in the well-studied |FRAME:TAX-562| many details of ppGpp action remain to be elucidated. Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [15866041] [18359660]|.</Comment>
