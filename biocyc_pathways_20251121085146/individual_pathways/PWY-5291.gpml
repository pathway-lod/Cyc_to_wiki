  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General Information:&lt;/b&gt; Astaxanthin (3,3&apos;-dihydroxy-4,4&apos;-diketo-&amp;beta;,&amp;beta;-carotene) is the red ketocarotenoid. This pigment gives the orange-red color to the flesh of wild salmon and other fish |CITS:[9491309]|. The pigment is ingested by the animals through their feed and accumulates in their skin, muscle, exoskeleton and gonads. In the aquatic environment, astaxanthin (AX) is produced by microalgae which are consumed by zooplankton, insects or crustaceans, to be finally ingested by fish. Farmed fish and crustaceans which do not have access to the natural sources of AX have their feed supplemented with synthetic AX. Incidentally, |FRAME:CPD-7851|, an intermediate ketocarotenoid in the biosynthesis AX, is also used as a synthetic supplement for the pigmentation of farmed fish although AX is usually preferred to canthaxanthin due its higher color intensity achieved at similar concentration |CITS:[Storebakken92]|; AX is also thought to be deposited in the muscles more efficiently (probably the result of a better absorption through the digestive tract) although this observation might be species-dependent |CITS:[torrisen89],[10554206],[buttle01]|. In addition to its relevance as a pigment, AX has many other important functions particularly in fish reproduction. Indeed, this compound was shown to be involved in acceleration of sexual maturity, increase in fertilization and egg survival, as well as a better embryo development of fish |CITS:[putnam91]|. That being said, AX is mostly known for its antioxidant properties, which have been reported to surpass even those of |FRAME:CPD1F-129| or |FRAME:ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL| |CITS:[miki91]|. These properties have led to the initiation of a number of pre-clinical trials aiming to test the effectiveness of AX as an anticancer drug, its prevention of cardiovascular drugs or as a booster of the immune system (for more information, please see the recent review by |CITS:[16431409]|). The biosynthesis of astaxanthin mainly occurs in a number of bacteria (e.g. &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium lacticola&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Agrobacterium aurantiacum&lt;/i&gt;), fungi (e.g. &lt;i&gt;Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous&lt;/i&gt;) and in a few unicellular algae (e.g. &lt;i&gt;Haematococcus pluvialis&lt;/i&gt;) |CITS:[goodwin80],[16001255],[16431409]|. In plants, astaxanthin is mostly only found in the &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; sp. where it is found to accumulate in the flowers; very few other plants produce this compound. Astaxanthin presents three stereochemical isomers: two enantiomers (|FRAME:CPD-7847| and |FRAME:CPD-7957|) and a &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; form (|FRAME:CPD-7958|). The 3S,3&apos;S form is the most abundant in nature. Synthetic astaxanthin consists of a racemic mixture of all three forms. Finally, astaxanthin can be found associated to a variety of other compounds: sterified in one or both of the hydroxyl groups with fatty acids (e.g. palmitic, oleic, estearic or linoleic), bound to proteins (carotenoproteins), or lipoproteins (carotenolipoproteins). &lt;b&gt;About this pathway:&lt;/b&gt; The pathway leading to astaxanthin is &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; sp. appears to be similar to that observed in other species (see |FRAME:PWY-5288|). Recent study of the enzymes catalyzing the formation of the C4 keto groups has however shown to function according to a mechanism different from that of the carotene 4-ketolases described for other organisms |CITS:[8764486],[7750556],[9523693],[7733978],[7592436]|. Indeed, whereas microbial enzymes appears to catalyze the reaction following a simple one-step mechanism marked by an absence of release of catalytic intermediates, the &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; enzymes Keto1 and Keto2 appear to be bifunctional enzymes with 4-hydroxylase and 3,4-desaturase activities. It had been previously postulated that the formation of the C4-keto group occurred &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the oxidation of 4-hydroxyls, based on the observation that carotenoids with 4-hydroxy-&amp;beta;-rings were found in large quantities in yellow-petalled &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; flowers unable to produce ketocartenoids |CITS:[czygan69]|. Instead, it would appear that the dual activity of &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; &apos;Keto&apos; enzymes (4-hydroxylase/3,4-desaturase) leads to the formation of enol tautomers which spontaneously rearrange to form a more stable keto tautomer form (for example, the enol tautomer |FRAME:CPD-7854|, reaches equilibrium with the keto tautomer |FRAME:CPD-7851|). To date, the activities of the &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; Keto enzymes have only been assessed for the conversion of |FRAME:CPD1F-129| to |FRAME:CPD-7851| |CITS:[15659105]|. It is however postulated that, in &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; sp., all reaction leading to the formation of the C4-keto group of ketocarotenoids in the |FRAME:PWY-5288| pathway will be similar to that of canthaxanthin presented in this pathway. A number of other compounds with a single C4-keto groups (e.g. |FRAME:CPD-7860| and |FRAME:CPD-7861|) also appear to be produced |CITS:[15659105]|. &lt;b&gt;Important note:&lt;/b&gt; Although the 3,4-didehydro- and 4-hydroxy-&amp;beta;-ring intermediates are detected when the &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; genes are expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, none of these compounds have been detected in the flowers of &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; (or any other plants). The authors of the study have therefore postulated that the bacterial system might provide a suboptimal comparison system for the events occuring in &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; chromoplasts. They postulated that these intermediates might be the result of an aberrant or premature release from the &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; enzymes and might, under normal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; conditions be short-lived intermediates |CITS:[15659105]|.</Description>

      <Comment>The &lt;i&gt;Adonis aestivalis&lt;/i&gt; gene &lt;i&gt;Keto1&lt;/i&gt; was isolated using a visual detection screen: a &amp;beta;-carotene-accumulating &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;strain was transformed with an &lt;i&gt;A. aestivalis&lt;/i&gt; flower cDNA library; colonies displaying an orange color, as opposed to a yellow coloration, were selected on the basis of their putative ability to form ketocarotenoids |CITS:[15659105]|. Sequence similarity analysis of &lt;i&gt;Adonis Keto1&lt;/i&gt; matched the gene product to plant &amp;beta;-carotene 3-hydroxylases such as |FRAME:CPLX1F-106|, rather than &amp;beta;-carotene 4-ketolases. That being said, when the enzyme was introduced into &amp;beta;-carotene-&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strains, the enzyme did not display either 4-ketolase or 3-hydroxylase activity. Instead, it was shown to lead to the production of a variety of compounds indicating that this enzyme most likely has 4-hydroxylase and 3,4-desaturase activities |CITS:[15659105]|. Using this assay method, the major products obtained from &amp;beta;-carotene were neither |FRAME:CPD-7850| nor |FRAME:CPD-7851|. Instead a variety of 3,4-didehydro- and 4-hydroxy-&amp;beta;-ring intermediates were detected. None of these compounds have been detected in the flowers of &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; (or any other plants) leading the authors of this study to speculate that the bacterial system might provide a suboptimal proxy system for the events occurring in &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; chromoplasts. They postulated that these intermediates might be the result of an aberrant or premature release from the &lt;i&gt;Adonis&lt;/i&gt; enzymes and might, under normal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; conditions be short-lived intermediates |CITS:[15659105]|. The dual enzymatic activity of &lt;i&gt;Keto1&lt;/i&gt; is thought to result in the formation of enol tautomers which would spontaneously tautomerize to their keto form as is shown in the |FRAME:PWY-5291| pathway. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies of the enzyme will finally determine whether the activities demonstrated in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; are also valid &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.</Comment>

      <Comment>In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity. When accepting electrons, it acts as an &quot;electron acceptor&quot;. By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called &quot;an oxidized electron acceptor&quot; and after receiving them it is called &quot;a reduced electron acceptor&quot;. Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as &quot;terminal electron acceptors&quot;. While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity. Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins &quot;blue copper proteins&quot;|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|). In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors. In many cases, purified enzymes can act &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; using an artificial electron carrier, and their &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electron carrier is not known. The classes of &quot;unknown electron carriers&quot; are used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.</Comment>
