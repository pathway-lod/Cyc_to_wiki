  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General background&lt;/b&gt;: Gentiodelphin, i.e. delphinidin 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosyl-5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-caffeoylglucoside-3&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-caffeoylglucoside found in the genus Gentiana is a unusual stable anthocyanin conferring deep blue flower colors to this species |CITS: [GOTO82]|. The stability of this compound has been proposed as an effect of the intramolecular stacking of acyl residues attached to the opposite sides of the A and B-ring sandwiching the corresponding anthocyanidin |CITS: [YOSHIDA91]|. The anthocyanidins are self-assembled into chiral supramolecular complexes that have been proposed to contribute to biological functions such as UV protection and specific color variations to attract insects for pollination |CITS: [16385618]|. Research on mono-deacyl derivatives of gentiodelphin, i.e. albireodelphin (acetylated in the A-ring 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside) and mono-deacylgentiodelphin (acytelated in the B-ring 3&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside) revealed that the positioning of the caffeoyl residues is vital to stability and coloration of the anthocyanidin. The caffeoyl residue attached to the 3&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside of the B-ring contributed more stability through intramolecular stacking and more color development to gentiodelphin than the caffeoyl residue on the A-ring |CITS: [10846752]|. &lt;b&gt;About the pathway&lt;/b&gt;: The first committed step in the gentiodelphin biosynthesis is the 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosylation of delphinidin 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside. The enzyme has been characterized from &lt;i&gt;Perilla frutescens&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [10066805]| but the activity of the anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5-GT) has also been reported (unpublished results) in crude extracts of &lt;i&gt;Gentiana triflora&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [9363752]|. The next steps that further decorate delphinidin 3,5-glucoside with caffeic acid and glucose are proposed to constitute a metabolic grid in the biosynthetic route towards gentiodelphin. Both possible routes, i.e. 3&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosylation followed by the aromatic 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acylation or vice versa are displayed and thought to be present in Gentiana |CITS: [9881162]| |CITS: [12857844]|. The glucosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of gentiodelphin are highly position specific and follow a defined order which is the 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosylation followed by the 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosylation and the subsequent 3&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosylation of the delphinidin backbone |CITS: [12857844]|. Although the function of the anthocyanin 3&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosyltransferase characterized in &lt;i&gt;Clitoria ternatea&lt;/i&gt; (compare |FRAME:PWY-5295|) |CITS: [Kazuma04]| is very similar to the 3&apos;GT involved in the biosynthesis of gentiodelphin (this pathway) there are differences, i.e. substrate preference between those enzymes with regard to the occurrence of acyl groups in the anthocyanidin molecule. The aromatic acylation with two caffeoyl residues also exhibits strict substrate specificity. The 5-aromatic acyltransferase |CITS: [9363752]| |CITS: [9881162]| can only acylate the 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside but not the 3, 7 or 3&apos; positions of anthocyanins. This enzyme has been located to the cytosol of the outer epidermal cells of petals |CITS: [9881162]| which coincides with the location of the 3&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosyltransferase whose activity has been only found in petals but not in sepals of &lt;i&gt;Gentiana triflora&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [12857844]|.

      <Comment source="THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, hartmut">The cDNA encoding anthocyanin 3&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosyltransferase (3&apos;GT) was isolated from petals of &lt;i&gt;Gentiana triflora&lt;/i&gt;. The enzyme was recombinant expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and its molecular function confirmed. In addition the enzyme was expressed in Petunia. The Petunia transformants accumulated the expected delphinidin 3,5,3&apos;-triglucoside but did not show a noticeable color change compared with the wild type. The 3&apos;GT only accepted substrates with 3&apos;,4&apos;,5&apos;-hydroxylation pattern including delphinidin 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoyl-5-O-caffeoylglucoside indicating the existence of an metabolic net for the formation of gentiodelphin with regard to acylation and glucosylation succession. However, delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside was the preferred substrate in comparison to delphinidin 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoyl-5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-caffeoylglucoside (51% relative activity). The overall structure of the anthocyanin was important for the acceptance as a substrate since delphinidin and delphinidin 3-glucoside were only poor substrates &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; possibly not being used at all &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. That finding signifies that the glucosylation pattern of delphinidin follows the order 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;, 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;, 3&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosylation. The enzyme was highly specific for UDP-glucose as donor and was competitively inhibited by UDP (Ki = 760 uM). The 3&apos;GT was mostly expressed during flower development in petals (but not in fully opened flowers) .</Comment>

      <Comment source="THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, hartmut">The cDNA encoding the 5-aromatic acyltransferase (5-AT) has been isolated from petals of &lt;i&gt;Gentiana triflora&lt;/i&gt;. The 5-AT attaches aromatic acyl residues such as caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid to the anthocyanin 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside. The molecular function of the enzyme was confirmed by heterologous expression in both &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and yeast . The enzyme was purified to homogeneity and characterized biochemically showing strict specificity for the 5-position but not for any other position of the anthocyanin molecule. However, the 5-AT expressed a broader substrate specificity accepting both delphinidin- and cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside which seems to be a common feature among acyltransferases . The 5-aromatic acyltransferase has been exclusively located to the cytosol of the outer epidermal cells of petals being temporally regulated during flower expression in accordance with other genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis .</Comment>

      <Comment source="O-28, hartmut">The activity of an anthocyanidin 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosyltransferase was detected in crude petal protein extracts from |FRAME:TAX-55190 &lt;i&gt;Gentiana triflora&lt;/i&gt;| converting anthocyanidin 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside into anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucoside. Using degenerate primers of 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosyltransferases of other plant species the cDNA encoding the anthocyanidin 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosyltransferase (5GT7) was cloned from petals of |FRAME:TAX-55190 &lt;i&gt;Gentiana triflora&lt;/i&gt;|. The highest activity of the unpurified anthocyanidin 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosyltransferase and the highest expression of the 5GT7 coincided and was found in the flower developmental stage 3 (anthesis). The |FRAME:TAX-21496 &lt;i&gt;Gentiana&lt;/i&gt;| cDNA was recombinant expressed in |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) and biochemically characterized. The 5GT7 accepted |FRAME:CPD-7117 delphinidin-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-D-glucoside| (100% relative activity) as the best substrate forming |FRAME:CPD-7139 delphinidin 3,5-di-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-D-glucoside| but catalyzed also the 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosylation of |FRAME:CPD1F-766 cyanidin-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-D-glucoside| (66% relative activity) and |FRAME:PELARGONIDIN-3-GLUCOSIDE-CMPD pelargonidin-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-D-glucoside| (45% relative activity) indicating of being able to form gentiocyanin as found in other |FRAME:TAX-21496 &lt;i&gt;Gentiana&lt;/i&gt;| species. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity of 5GT7 was confirmed after transferring the gene into tobacco accumulating typically |FRAME: CPD-15001 cyanidin-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-rutinoside|. The transgenic tobacco was able to produce the 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosylated |FRAME: CPD-15002 cyanidin-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-rutinoside-5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-D-glucoside| normally not found in this plant and, as a result, displayed a slightly deeper pink color than the wild type .</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue, SRI, caspi">UDP-glucose is an activated form of glucose that participates in a variety of enzymatic reactions, including: 1. Biosynthesis of glucose-containing compounds, such as polysaccharaides (glycogen, starch, laminarin and cellulose), disaccharides (sucrose, trehalose), &amp;beta;-glucosides, and glucosyl-ceramides. 2. Channeling galactose into the glycolytic pathway It has also been suggested that UDP-D-glucose can act as an extracellular signaling molecule |CITS: [12695547]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">Coenzyme A (CoA) is a ubiquitous compound found in archaea, bacteria, plants, and animals. It is a common acyl carrier in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and is required for a multitude of reactions for both biosynthetic and degradative pathways, including the oxidation of fatty acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids |CITS: [16415216]|. While the name &quot;coenzyme A&quot; is well established, the correct name for the function of the compound in enzymatic reactions is &quot;cosubstrate&quot;.</Comment>
