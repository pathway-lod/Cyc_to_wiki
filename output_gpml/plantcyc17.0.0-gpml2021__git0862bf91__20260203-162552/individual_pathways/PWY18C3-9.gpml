  <Description>Diacylsucroses (this pathway) are the metabolic intermediates biosynthesized from monoacylsucroses (see |FRAME:PWY18C3-8 monoacylsucrose biosynthesis (&lt;i&gt;Solanum&lt;/i&gt;)|) and precursors on the way to the triacyl- (see |FRAME:PWY18C3-10 triacylsucrose biosynthesis (&lt;i&gt;Solanum&lt;/i&gt;)|) and tetraacyl sucroses (see |FRAME:PWY18C3-11 tetraacylsucrose biosynthesis (&lt;i&gt;Solanum&lt;/i&gt;)|) usually accumulating in the cultivated tomato (&lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;) |CITS:[22988115] [24772058]|.

      <Comment source="O-28, hartmut">Using an genomic approach potential acyltransferases of the BAHD family  have been identified in the genome of &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopsersicum&lt;/i&gt; presumed to be able decorating the backbone of |FRAME:SUCROSE sucrose|. The orthologous gene to the &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; ASAT2 encoded acyltransferase in &lt;i&gt;Solanum pennellii&lt;/i&gt;, also referred to as ASAT2, has an amino acid identity of 95.1% to ASAT2 from &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;. However, the acyltransferase ASAT2 from &lt;i&gt;Solanum penellii&lt;/i&gt; exhibited only very low catalytic activities with |FRAME:CPD-19018 sucrose-4-isovalerate| and the various acyl-CoA&apos;s such as |FRAME: ISOVALERYL-COA isovaleryl-CoA|, |FRAME:ISOBUTYRYL-COA isobutanoyl-CoA|, |FRAME:2-METHYL-BUTYRYL-COA 2-methylbutanoyl-CoA|, |FRAME:CPD-10267 decanoyl-CoA| and |FRAME: LAUROYLCOA-CPD lauroyl-CoA| to form the respective |FRAME: CPD-19025 sucrose-3,4-diisovalerate|, |FRAME:CPD-19023 sucrose-3-isobutanoyl-4-isovalerate|, |FRAME:CPD-19026 sucrose-3-decanoyl-4-isovalerate|, |FRAME:CPD-19027 sucrose-3-lauroyl-4-isovalerate| and |FRAME:CPD-19025 sucrose-3-(2-methyl)butyryl-4-isovalerate| . Transgenic plant experiments crossing ASAT2 mutants, the &lt;i&gt;Solanum pennellii&lt;/i&gt; ASAT2 and the ASAT2 gene of &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; revealed the recessive nature of ASAT2 in &lt;i&gt;Solanum pennellii&lt;/i&gt;.

      <Comment source="O-28, hartmut">92 genes presumably encoding for acyltransferases of the BAHD family  have been identified in the genome of &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopsersicum&lt;/i&gt; potentially able to decorate the backbone of |FRAME:SUCROSE sucrose|. Those specialized acylsucrose metabolites are found in abundance in trichomes of members of the &lt;i&gt;Solanaceae&lt;/i&gt; family. Strong candidate genes have been silenced in RNAi transformed &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; plants. The subsequent metabolic profiling revealed that the ASAT2 encoded protein from &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopsersicum&lt;/i&gt; was able to use monoacylated metabolites produced by the ASAT1 encoded acyltransferase, to utilize various acyl-CoA&apos;s for further acylation. The ASAT2 encoded protein was heterologously expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, purified to homogeneity and subjected to biochemical assays to determine catalytic properties and substrate specificities. Using the recombinant ASAT2 acyltransferase of &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; and |FRAME:CPD-19018 sucrose-4-isovalerate| as substrate demonstrated the ability of the enzyme to efficiently use short and long chain acyl-CoA&apos;s. With the exception of the acyl donor |FRAME: ISOVALERYL-COA isovaleryl-CoA| which only generated negligible amounts of |FRAME: CPD-19025 sucrose-3,4-diisovalerate|, the ASAT2 encoded acyltransferase readily acylated the 3-position of the pyranose moiety of |FRAME:CPD-19018 sucrose-4-isovalerate| and formed |FRAME:CPD-19023 sucrose-3-isobutanoyl-4-isovalerate| with |FRAME:ISOBUTYRYL-COA isobutanoyl-CoA|, |FRAME:CPD-19026 sucrose-3-decanoyl-4-isovalerate| with |FRAME:2-METHYL-BUTYRYL-COA 2-methylbutanoyl-CoA|, |FRAME:CPD-19027 sucrose-3-lauroyl-4-isovalerate| with |FRAME:CPD-10267 decanoyl-CoA| and |FRAME:CPD-19025 sucrose-3-(2-methyl)butyryl-4-isovalerate| with |FRAME: LAUROYLCOA-CPD lauroyl-CoA|. As previously shown for ASAT1, the ASAT2 encoded protein was also inhibited by increasing concentration of the long-chain acyl-CoA |FRAME:LAUROYLCOA-CPD lauroyl-CoA|. In addition, functional complementation of introgression mutants with the ASAT2 gene restored the metabolic profile of &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopsersicum&lt;/i&gt; and confirmed the function of the ASAT2 encoded protein as 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acyltransferase participating in the biosynthesis of a variety of oligo-acylsucroses. The function of the ASAT2 encoded acyltransferase was also shown in an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiment where all four acyltransferases (ASAT1-4) are in the mix and act simultaneously on |FRAME:SUCROSE sucrose| and various acyl-CoA&apos;s producing the main acylsucrose metabolites found in &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; . The substrate specificity of the ASAT2 enzyme has been shown to be dependent on two amino acid residues in the vicinity of the putative acyl-CoA-binding pocket , i.e. Val/Phe408 which strongly determined whether or not |FRAME:ISOVALERYL-COA isovaleryl-CoA| is used as acyl donor and Leu43 which governed the use of |FRAME:2-METHYL-BUTYRYL-COA 2-methylbutanoyl-CoA| as acyl donor . The mRNA of ASAT2 has been shown by to accumulate in the I/IV-trichomes, the presumed place of production of acylsugars in &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;. The tip cells of I/IV-trichomes also highly expressed GFP (green fluorescent protein)-&amp;beta;-glucuronidase (GFP-GUS) reporter genes associated with ASAT2 confirming the cellular location of the enzyme .</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">Coenzyme A (CoA) is a ubiquitous compound found in archaea, bacteria, plants, and animals. It is a common acyl carrier in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and is required for a multitude of reactions for both biosynthetic and degradative pathways, including the oxidation of fatty acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids |CITS: [16415216]|. While the name &quot;coenzyme A&quot; is well established, the correct name for the function of the compound in enzymatic reactions is &quot;cosubstrate&quot;.</Comment>
