  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General Information:&lt;/b&gt; Phytate (phytic acid) is the most abundant &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol phosphate (hexa&lt;i&gt;kis&lt;/i&gt;phosphate) in plant cells. Phytate serves as a storage form of &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol, phosphate and mineral nutrients for utilization during seed germination and seedling growth. It is deposited within single-membrane storage organelles referred to as protein bodies and is usually present as mixed complexes with minerals (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) known as phytin |CITS:[11590064],[8744268]|. Up to 80% of the total seed phosphorus is stored in phytin |CITS:[15700415]|. Although phytate is found in large quantities in seeds, it is also present in other plant tissues and organs such as pollen, roots, tuber and turions (for review see |CITS:[14568069]|). The potential of phytate to form very stable complexes with mineral and proteins confers upon this molecule its notorious antinutritional properties. Humans and monogastric animals lack the hydrolytic phytases in their digestive tract. Therefore, the high concentrations of phytate in food grains and its ability to chelate mineral cations compromise mineral absorption. Undigested phytate in animal waste also contributes to eutrophication and environmental phosphorus pollution |CITS:[11590064],[11906835]|. The degradation of phytate is achieved by a group of enzymes called phytases which have been mostly studied in microorganisms and plants. Phytases belong to a special class of phosphomonoesterases and are capable of initiating the stepwise release of phosphate from phytate. Phytases are used to reduce the level of phosphate pollution in areas of intensive animal production. Addition of adequate amounts of microbial phytases in animal feed improves the utilization of phosphate from phytate, allowing for a reduction in inorganic phosphate supplementation in the diets for simple-stomached animals. As a result, the fecal phosphate excretion of these animals may be reduced by up to 50%. Finally, phytases can improve the nutritional value of plant-based foods (especially grains) by increasing the availability of the minerals chelated in phytin. &lt;b&gt;This Pathway in Plants:&lt;/b&gt; The degradation of phytate into &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol phosphate intermediates and, finally, &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol, is performed by phytases which catalyze the removal of all the phosphate residues of the phytate molecule in a sequential order. Each &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol intermediate is released from the enzyme and may become a substrate for further hydrolysis |CITS:[12405789]|. Unlike the better characterized phytate degradation pathway from cereals and legumes (see |FRAME:PWY-4702|), which has been confirmed by metabolic profiling as well as enzymatic information, this pathway results mainly from the activity of the &lt;i&gt;Phaseolus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; phytase activity. This enzyme was shown to degrade phytate through the sequential removal of phosphates: D-6 followed by D-5, then D-4 or D-1 and finally D-3 |CITS:[MAITI74]|.</Description>

      <Comment>A phytase was purified from germinated 4-day-old &lt;i&gt;Lupinus albus&lt;/i&gt; seedlings . This monomeric enzyme was shown to dephosphorylate phytate at position 4, thereby producing Ins(1,2,3,5,6)P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; . Like many phytases, the enzyme displays substrate inhibition at phytate concentrations &gt;8 mmol.L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; . The enzyme has a pH optimum of 5.0. The purified enzyme is stable over a 3.5-7.5 pH-range but is virtually inactive below pH 3.0 and above pH 8.0 . Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; were shown to reduce phytase activity. This effect was attributed to a lowering of phytate concentrations due to appearance of an iron phytate precipitate . The enzyme is not a metalloenzyme.</Comment>

      <Comment>This enzyme isolated from germinated &lt;i&gt;Phaseolus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (Mung bean) cotyledons (but inactive in ungerminated seeds) has &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol hexa&lt;i&gt;kis&lt;/i&gt;phosphate phosphohydrolase (phytase) activity. The purified enzyme was shown to dephosphorylate phytate by liberating the phosphate at position D-6 first, followed by those at position D-5 then D-4 or D-1 and, finally, D-3. The phosphate at position D-2 is stable showing that this enzyme does not lead to the degradation phytate all the way to &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol but stops at Ins(2)P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; instead. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 7.5 with phytate. &lt;i&gt;Sn&lt;/i&gt;-3-glycerophosphocholine was shown to have aregulatory role on the enzyme activity; it is promotive below 30 &amp;mu;M and inhibitory at higher concentrations (competitive inhibition with a K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of 60 &amp;mu;M |CITS:[MAITI74]|.</Comment>

      <Comment>A phytase (PHY1) was purified from wheat bran of &lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt; |CITS:[NAKANO99],[10879469]|. This enzyme was shown to have a high affinity for phytate and a low sensitivity for inhibition by inorganic phosphate. The stability of PHY1 was assessed at 37?C: the activity after 24, 48 and 72 h was about 50, 25 and 10% of 0-h, respectively . Purified PHY1 was shown &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to lead to the conversion of phytate to &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol via Ins(1,2,3,5,6)P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. From this compound, further degradation proceeds via two routes: the main route follows Ins(1,2,5,6)P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Ins(1,2,6)P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Ins(1,2)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while the minor route follows Ins(1,2,3,6)P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Ins(1,2,3)P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Ins(1,2)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . An isozyme of PHY1 was characterized (PHY2) which was described to have the same characteristics as PHY1 .</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">The most abundant form of the phosphate ion at pH 7.3 is hydrogenphosphate. To simplify the presentation of reactions taking place at physiological pH, MetaCyc does not distinguish between the two forms, and uses the name &quot;phosphate&quot; even though the structure shown is that of hydrogenphosphate.</Comment>

In plant seeds, large amount of phytate are complexed with cations and deposited as globular inclusions in membrane-bound storage bodies |CITS: [15700415]|.
