  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General background&lt;/b&gt;: Anthocyanins are water-soluble, secondary plant products that constitute a major subgroup (about 15 to 20%) of flavonoids |CITS: [Andersen06]|. Almost all vascular plants possess basic anthocyanins such as pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside and cyaniding-3-O-glucoside (this pathway) responsible for the red to magenta coloration of flowers and fruits and delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (|FRAME:PWY-5153 anthocyanin biosynthesis (delphinidin 3-O-glucoside)|) introducing blue tones to the floral organs of plants |CITS: [11130659]|. Anthocyanins play important roles as pigments of flowers and fruits in numerous plants across the plant kingdom to attract insects for pollination and act as protectants against UV-B irradiation |CITS: [14561507]|. They also exhibit anti-oxidant activities and therefore may serve as potential anticancer |CITS: [16084717]| and anti-arteriosclerosis compounds in human health |CITS: [15282635]| |CITS: [12828368]| |CITS: [11960739]|. Anthocyanines constitute biological active metabolites that also modulate inter-species relationships being intimately connected with the co-existence of plants with, e.g. insects, mammals, and birds |CITS: [11820759]|. &lt;b&gt;About the pathway&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;b&gt;Enzymes&lt;/b&gt;: The crucial step in this pathway is the oxidation of leucoanthocyanidins to generate respective cyanidins. Despite of intensive research over the last years (e.g. |CITS: [14552794]| |CITS: [16106293]|) this enzymatic step is still not completely understood and requires further study. Anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), a 2-oxoglutarate iron-dependent oxygenase, catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the anthocyanin class of flavonoids |CITS: [11796114]|. Anthocyanidin synthase catalyzes the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; conversion of leucoanthocyanidins to dihydroflavonol and flavonol intermediates (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-isoforms) and to a minor degree anthocyanidins |CITS: [Turnbull00]|. In addition, (+)-catechin was found to be accepted by the ANS forming a 4,4-dimer of the oxidized (+)-catechin |CITS: [16494872]|. The formation of colored anthocyanidins such as pelargonidin and cyanidin from colorless leucoanthocyanidins (leucopelargonidin, leucocyanidin) was detected by the ANS-catalyzed reaction in the presence of ferrous ion, 2-oxoglutarate and ascorbate, being followed by acidification with HCI |CITS: [10074715]|. It has been shown that recombinant ANSs from several model plant species, snapdragon, petunia, torenia, and maize, catalyze the formation of anthocyanidins &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; through a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxidation of corresponding leucoanthocyanidins |CITS: [11316805]|. Assuming that the site of initial oxidation is the same for anthocyanidin and dihydroflavonol formation, evidence is presented for initial oxidation at the C-3 position of the flavonoid C-ring and for two bifurcating steps during catalysis by anthocyanidin synthase |CITS: [12240335]|. It is assumed that the anthocyanidin synthase proceeds via stereospecific hydroxylation at the C-3 atom of the leucocyanidins which furthermore spontaneously dehydrate and finally form stable isomers, i.e. anthocyanidin pseudobase (3-flaven-2,3-diol) |CITS: [DAVIES06]|. The other enzyme of the pathway, UDPG: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (3-UGT) is considered as a final enzyme necessary for producing the earliest stable anthocyanin molecules in plant cells |CITS: [KITAMURA06]|. Glucosylation is one of the most prominent modifications of compounds involved in plant secondary metabolism and often represents final steps within a pathway |CITS: [15647808]|. Flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferases catalyzing red to magenta colored anthocyanins have been identified in many plant genera such as Arabidopsis |CITS: [15807784]| and Gentiana |CITS: [8819318]|. &lt;b&gt;Regulation&lt;/b&gt;: The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway belongs to one of the most intensely studied areas of plant secondary metabolism |CITS: [11743081]| and provides probably the best-investigated regulatory system in plants |CITS: [15860424]| |CITS: [QUATTROCCHIO06]|. It has long been suggested that enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathweay form multienzyme complexes that channel substrates towards required metabolic routes and entail a complex regulation |CITS: [STAFFORD74]| |CITS: [3970546]|. Anthocyanin and proanthocyanin biosynthesis is basically regulated by transcription factors with MYB or helix-loop-helix (HLH) domains and a WD40 protein. Those proteins are able to mutually interact in response to the demand of the plant resulting in the activation of corresponding structural pigmentation genes |CITS: [16464150]| |CITS: [15882656]| |CITS: [12586894]|. Little is known so far what regulates the regulators, but light and plant hormones have been established to be central to the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes |CITS: [16464150]|. &lt;b&gt;Transport&lt;/b&gt;: Anthocyanins are known to be accumulated in vacuoles where the acidic environment finally causes the alteration from colorless to colored pigments. A growing body of evidence specifies that flavonoid synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm indicating that a transport step is involved in the overall biosynthesis scheme |CITS: [KITAMURA06]| |CITS: [16464150]|. Genes encoding glutathione S-transferases (GST&apos;s) linked to the sequestration of anthocyanins into the tonoplast have been found in Petunia (AN9) |CITS: [10938372]|, carnation |CITS: [12789508]| and Arabidopsis (TT19) |CITS: [14675436]|. Besides transporters that bind to certain anthocyanins and carry them to the vacuole special intravacuolar bodies, i.e. anthocyanic vacuolar inclusions (AVIs) have been found to be involved in the transport and/or accumulation of anthocyanins. They appear to serve as anthocyanin traps concentrating the pigments (preferentially anthocyanidin 3,5-diglycosides) to a proteinaceous matrix |CITS: [11117881]|.</Description>

      <Comment source="O-28, hartmut">The rose cultivars &apos;Charleston&apos; and &apos;Ehigasa&apos; accumulate both |FRAME:CPD1F-766 cyanidin-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-D-glucoside| and |FRAME:CPD-7138 cyanidin 3,5-di-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-D-glucoside| in mature petals indicating an existing pathway to |FRAME:CPD1F-766 cyanidin-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-D-glucoside|. The activity of an flavonoid 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosyltransferase specific for the |FRAME: CPD-12575 UDP-&amp;alpha;-D-glucose| dependent 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosylation of the C-ring in anthocyanidins was identified in petal extracts of |FRAME:TAX-128735 &lt;i&gt;Rosa hybrid cultivar&lt;/i&gt;|. Using DNA sequences of anthocyanidin 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosyltransferases from other species (petunia, gentian, perilla) as templates the screening of a directional cDNA library of young colored rose leaves resulted in the identification of the cDNA for the rose anthocyanidin 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucosyltransferase (UF3GT1). The UF3GT1 was recombinant expressed in |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| and some of the catalytic properties determined. The UF3GT1 accepted the anthocyanidins |FRAME:CPD-591 cyanidin| (57% relative activity), |FRAME:PELARGONIDIN-CMPD pelargonidin| (100% relative activity) and |FRAME:CPD-7090 delphinidin| (89% relative activity). The expression of UF3GT1 correlated with anthocyanin accumulation in mature petals of the cultivars &apos;Charleston&apos; and &apos;Ehigasa&apos;. However, in other cultivars UF3GT1 was not present, hence not involved in |FRAME:CPD1F-766 cyanidin-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-D-glucoside| formation |CITS:[Fukuchi-Mizutani11]|.</Comment>

      <Comment>The cDNA encoding the anthocyanin 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) in &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; attaching a glucose moiety to the 3-position of the C-ring was isolated and recombinant expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. The purified, recombinant enzyme expressed a high affinity towards flavonol and anthocyanidin substrates. However, a comparison of the UFGT acitivity obtained from two &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; varieties, one with white berries and the other one having red berries demonstrated that the enzyme is not responsible for the glucosylation of flavonols &lt;i&gt;in planta&lt;/i&gt; despite its ability to do so &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Hence, the true natural substrates for the UFGT are anthocyanidins produced in the red grapes. The glucosylation reaction was strongly inhibited by Cu &lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; but it has been found that Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; acts rather on the anthocyanidin substrates (bleaching, structure change) than on the enzyme itself .</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">The At5g17050 gene has been found to encode a flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; introducing a glucose group to the 3-position of the flavonoid C-ring. The gene was induced in response to plants overexpressing the PAP1 gene encoding an MYB transcription factor. Homozygote mutants bearing T-DNA insertions of the gene did not produce the protein and were found to contain significantly less anthocyanins than the wild type. The molecular function was confirmed by expressing recombinant proteins in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. The enzyme accepted both anthocyanidins (cyanidin, pelargonidin and delphinidin) and flavonols (kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin) and converted them to the corresponding 3-O-glucosides. The enzyme also accepted flavonoids which have not been found in Arabidopsis (delphinidin, myricetin) . The molecular function of At5g17050 as flavonoid/anthocyanin 3-O-glucosyltransferase was confirmed using the anthocyaninless1 (anl1) mutant of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; which showed a dramatic loss of glucosylated anthocyanin. The gene At5g17050 was expressed in all tissues investigated such as rosette leaves, stems, flower buds and roots .</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue, SRI, caspi">UDP-glucose is an activated form of glucose that participates in a variety of enzymatic reactions, including: 1. Biosynthesis of glucose-containing compounds, such as polysaccharaides (glycogen, starch, laminarin and cellulose), disaccharides (sucrose, trehalose), &amp;beta;-glucosides, and glucosyl-ceramides. 2. Channeling galactose into the glycolytic pathway It has also been suggested that UDP-D-glucose can act as an extracellular signaling molecule |CITS: [12695547]|.</Comment>
