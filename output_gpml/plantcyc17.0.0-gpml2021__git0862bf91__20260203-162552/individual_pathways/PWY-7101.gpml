  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt; |FRAME: Strigolactones Strigolactones| are plant hormones that stimulate the branching and growth of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, but inhibit plant shoot branching.

The gene encodes a |FRAME: AT2G44990-MONOMER 9-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-carotene 9&apos;,10&apos;-cleavage dioxygenase| that cleaves |FRAME: CPD-14646 9-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-carotene| between positions 10&apos; and 9&apos;, an early reaction in the pathway leading to production of strigolactones . As typical to genes involved in this pathway, mutants in CCD7 display a dramatic increase in lateral branching . In an earlier work the protein was expressed in carotenoid-accumulating strains of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and tested &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with several of the most common plant carotenoids. It was reported that the recombinant protein catalyzes the specific 9&apos;-10&apos; cleavage of |FRAME: CPD1F-129 &lt;i&gt;all-trans&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-carotene|, producing |FRAME: CPD-13368 &lt;i&gt;all-trans&lt;/i&gt;-10&apos;-apo-&amp;beta;-carotenal| . However, later work showed that the actual substrate for the enzyme is |FRAME: CPD-14646 9-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-carotene| . In that work, all other &amp;beta;-carotene isomers, including &lt;i&gt;all-trans&lt;/i&gt;-, 13-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-, and 15-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;beta;-carotene, were not converted.

      <Comment>In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity. When accepting electrons, it acts as an &quot;electron acceptor&quot;. By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called &quot;an oxidized electron acceptor&quot; and after receiving them it is called &quot;a reduced electron acceptor&quot;. Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as &quot;terminal electron acceptors&quot;. While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity. Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins &quot;blue copper proteins&quot;|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|). In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors. In many cases, purified enzymes can act &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; using an artificial electron carrier, and their &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electron carrier is not known. This class of &quot;unknown electron carriers&quot; is used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.</Comment>

      <Comment>In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity. When accepting electrons, it acts as an &quot;electron acceptor&quot;. By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called &quot;an oxidized electron acceptor&quot; and after receiving them it is called &quot;a reduced electron acceptor&quot;. Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as &quot;terminal electron acceptors&quot;. While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity. Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins &quot;blue copper proteins&quot;|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|). In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors. In many cases, purified enzymes can act &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; using an artificial electron carrier, and their &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electron carrier is not known. The classes of &quot;unknown electron carriers&quot; are used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.</Comment>
