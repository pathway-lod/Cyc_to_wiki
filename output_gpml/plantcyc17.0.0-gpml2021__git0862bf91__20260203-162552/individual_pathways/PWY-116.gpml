  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General background&lt;/b&gt;: Glucosyltransferases as one subclass of glycosyltransferases are involved in the glucosylation of a broad variety of secondary plant metabolites, amongst them monolignols involved in the metabolic sequence of lignin biosynthesis |CITS: [Ibrahim77]| |CITS: [Foerster99]|. Modifying enzymes such as the multigene family of glucosyltransferases contribute to the plasticity of metabolism where corresponding products are either involved in a particular biosynthetic route or may act as gateways into different metabolic pathways |CITS: [11042211]| |CITS: [10973093]|. The presence and significance to lignification of glucosylated cinnamyl alcohols in the cambium of woody plants were emphasized several decades ago by Freudenberg |CITS: [Freudenberg63]| |CITS: [5593877]|. Although glucosyltransferases in general may cover a broad substrate spectrum it has been demonstrated that certain glucosyltransferases exhibit a rather strict specificity towards their substrates |CITS: [4731963]| |CITS: [11430981]| |CITS: [15907484]|. Extensive research has revised the view about how the metabolic sequence for lignin formation proceeds in plants. It appears that the interconversion of lignin precursors may occur at varied points along the lignification pathway, along a preferred metabolic route, but most probably not at the phenylpropanoid acid stage |CITS: [11960740]| |CITS: [14503002]|. Furthermore, the ratio of guaiacyl to syringyl units can be modified at the level of CoA esters |CITS: [GRIMMIG99]|, cinnamyl aldehydes |CITS: [10430877]|, cinnamyl alcohols |CITS: [14709025]| and monolignol glucosides |CITS: [MATSUI96]|. However, it is still a matter of debate whether and to what extent monomeric alcohol and aldehyde glucosides are involved in the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; lignin biosynthesis |CITS: [11430981]| |CITS: [15986215]| and more research is needed to address this issue. The CAGT activity obtained from seasonal harvests of cambium and developing xylem appeared synchronously with resumption of cambial cell-division activity and is, as its product coniferin, completely undetectable in dormant tissues |CITS: [Savidge98]| |CITS: [Foerster99]|. This link between cambial and enzymatic activity still remains to be demonstrated for the enzymatic counterpart of this pathway, the coniferin specific &amp;beta;-glucosidase |CITS: [7765617]| |CITS: [7724669]| |CITS: [10412914]| which liberates the aglycones and makes them available for the final assembly of lignin. The turnover of coniferin in pine seedlings has been measured with a half life in the order of 60 to 120 hr, but a quantitative correlation between coniferin turnover and lignification could not be established |CITS: [27355]|. Coniferin accumulation appears to be under hormonal control. The metabolization of exogenous coniferin in dependence on hormone supplements has been demonstrated in cell cultures of &lt;i&gt;Pinus strobus&lt;/i&gt; cambium |CITS: [Savidge89]|. A combination of auxin-cytokinin in the media quickly abolished exogenous applied coniferin whereas the control experiment (auxin and cytokinin alone) had no such effect. It was discussed that a defined ratio of auxin to cytokinin promotes coniferin hydrolysis as demonstrated in various plant tissues |CITS: [HOSEL82]| and that the varying ratio of this plant hormones throughout the cambial region may be the regulative principle for the observed spatial and temporal phenomenon of accumulation or disappearance of coniferin |CITS: [Savidge89]|. Proof for the significance of exogenous and endogenous signals on the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids and their derivatives is also the recently published accumulation of coniferin and syringin upon light induction in roots of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [15144378]|. The reported coniferin accumulation is the result of a high-irradiance response (HIR) demonstrating the involvement of primary photoreceptors such as phytochrome and cryptochrome. &lt;b&gt;About the pathway:&lt;/b&gt; The most prominent monolignol glucoside accumulating in a variety of plants is the 4-O-&amp;beta;-D-glucopyranoside of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-coniferyl alcohol, i.e. coniferin. The enzyme catalyzing the formation of coniferin has been purified from different plant sources |CITS: [10853]| and appears to be most active in developing xylem of gymnosperms |CITS: [6210530]| |CITS: [11430981]|. The UDPG:coniferyl alcohol glucosyltransferase (CAGT) also glucosylates sinapyl alcohol with high efficiency in pine cambium |CITS: [Savidge98]| |CITS: [Foerster00]| and cell cultures of &lt;i&gt;Forsythia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rosa&lt;/i&gt; spec. |CITS: [Ibrahim77]| |CITS: [10853]|. In addition, coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes have been converted with comparable catalytic efficiency |CITS: [6210530]| |CITS: [11430981]| |CITS: [10853]| (|FRAME:PWY-83|). The coniferin specific &amp;beta;-glucosidase (and isomers thereof) was isolated from the differentiating xylem of pines and characterized with regard to biochemical and molecular features |CITS: [7765617]| |CITS: [7724669]| |CITS: [10412914]|. The &amp;beta;-glucosidase specifically acts on coniferin and syringin and has been shown to be exclusively localized to the differentiating xylem |CITS: [7724669]| supporting a potential role of the enzyme in the lignification process. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; finding that coniferylaldehyde glucoside can be enzymatically derive from coniferin and that the aldehyde glucoside can be deglucosylated to yield coniferylaldehyde suggest an alternative pathway for coniferin to enter the monolignol biosynthetic route |CITS: [15986215]|.</Description>

      <Comment source="PMN, dreher">&lt;i&gt;Togt1&lt;/i&gt; (tobacco glucosyltransferase 1) is a member of group D of the glycosyltransferase. Members of this group have been shown to act on a wide variety of substrates. Based on &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays, the Togt1 protein can act upon a number of phenylpropanoids and it has a low level of activity against some benzoic compounds, such as |FRAME: CPD-110 salicylate| . One of the highest levels of Togt1 activity is observed with |FRAME: SCOPOLETIN scopoletin|, a compound with antimicrobial properties |CITS: [VALLE97]|. Scopoletin levels increase in tomato during a hypersensitive response (HR) reaction to TMV (tobacco mosaic virus) , however, &lt;i&gt;in planta&lt;/i&gt; its glycoside, |FRAME: SCOPOLIN scopolin| accumulates. Given the potential role of this enzyme in defense and the hypersensitive response, it is not surprising the Togt1 is induced by a fungal elicitor, the defense hormone salicylic acid, and during TMV-stimulated HR . Moreover, over-expression of Togt1 in tobacco leads to increased scopolin-glucosyltransferase activity and an accelerated cell death in a hypersensitive response to TMV |CITS: [GACHON94]|. For the compounds tested using a GST:TOGT1 fusion expressed in &lt;i&gt;E.coli&lt;/i&gt;, the relative activities of TOGT1 using various substrates are roughly: |FRAME: SCOPOLETIN scopoletin| (100%), |FRAME: CPD-8097 esculetin| (110%), |FRAME: CPD-8186 umbelliferone| (40%), |FRAME: BENZOATE benzoate|, |FRAME: CPD-110 salicylate|, and |FRAME: 3-HYDROXYBENZOATE 3-hydroxybenzoate| (less than 10% each), |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate 4-hydroxybenzoate| (58%), |FRAME: CPD-674 &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cinnamate| (45%), |FRAME: COUMARATE 4-coumarate| (60%), |FRAME: CPD-676 &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-caffeate| (60%), |FRAME: FERULIC-ACID ferulate| (20%), |FRAME: 2-COUMARATE 2-coumarate| (58%), |FRAME: CONIFERYL-ALCOHOL coniferyl alcohol| (25%), and |FRAME: CAFFEOYLQUINATE &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-5-O-caffeoyl-D-quinate| (barely detectable) .</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue, SRI, caspi">UDP-glucose is an activated form of glucose that participates in a variety of enzymatic reactions, including: 1. Biosynthesis of glucose-containing compounds, such as polysaccharaides (glycogen, starch, laminarin and cellulose), disaccharides (sucrose, trehalose), &amp;beta;-glucosides, and glucosyl-ceramides. 2. Channeling galactose into the glycolytic pathway It has also been suggested that UDP-D-glucose can act as an extracellular signaling molecule |CITS: [12695547]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="SRI, caspi">This compound stands for a mixture of |FRAME: ALPHA-GLUCOSE| and |FRAME: GLC|. In most cases, each of these compounds mutarotates quickly to form a mixture of the two, and thus it is the general rule to use this non-specific form in reactions unless it is specifically known that an enzyme can accept only one of the forms.</Comment>
