  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt; Folates are required in a variety of reactions (known as one-carbon metabolism) in both bacterial and mammalian tissues, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides. During folate biosynthesis the enzyme |FRAME:EC-6.3.2.12 EC 6.3.2.12, dihydrofolate synthase|, adds an |FRAME:GLT L-glutamate| residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE 7,8-dihydropteroate|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE 7,8-dihydrofolate monoglutamate|, also known as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: GLT| is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. It is named after wheat gluten, from which it was described in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen. |FRAME: GLT| plays an important role in nitrogen metabolism in the cell. Once cells take up ammonium, it is fixed by incorporation into the TCA cycle intermediate |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| by |FRAME: EC-1.4.1.4|, forming |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [13239305]| (an additional ammonium molecule can be fixed into L-glutamate, e.g. by |FRAME: EC-6.3.1.2|, forming |FRAME: GLN| |CITS: [14833423]|). Glutamate then becomes the central source for passing amino groups on to other molecules by the action of transaminase (=aminotransferase) enzymes, distributing nitrogen throughout the cell. For example, glutamate can transfer the amino group to the common metabolites |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, forming |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE| and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, respectively. It has been estimated that glutamate and glutamine provide 75% and 25%, respectively, of all cellular nitrogen |CITS: [30026566]|. In addition to its protein building role, |FRAME: GLT| is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system, acting on ionotropic and metabotropic (G-protein coupled) receptors |CITS: [10736372]|. |FRAME: GLT| interacts with the umami taste receptors, which sense glutamates and nucleotides, imparting &quot;meaty&quot;, &quot;savory&quot;, and &quot;broth-like&quot; flavor. The monosodium salt of glutamate (MSG), which is found naturally in some foods, is often added to foodstuff for flavoring |CITS: [1679557]|. Although MSG is commnly believed to cause headaches, all scientific studies found no such effect |CITS: [27189588]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides. During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|. Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&amp;gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &amp;gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &amp;alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds. The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives. The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.</Comment>

      <Comment>|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides. During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|. Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&amp;gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &amp;gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &amp;alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds. The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives. The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|. This class stands for tetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.</Comment>

      <Comment source="BioCyc">Hydrolysis of a &amp;gamma;-glutamyl bond. A lysosomal or secreted, thiol-dependent peptidase, most active at acidic pH. Commonly studied with folylpoly-&amp;gamma;-glutamate as substrate, with which the initial cleavage may release glutamate or poly-&amp;gamma;-glutamate of two or more residues, according to the species of origin of the enzyme. Final products are pteroyl-&amp;alpha;-glutamate (folic acid) and free glutamate. Highly specific for the &amp;gamma;-glutamyl bond, but not for the C-terminal amino acid (leaving group). Action on &amp;gamma;-glutamyl bonds is independent of an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminal pteroyl moiety, but it is not known whether an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminal &amp;gamma;-Glu residue can be hydrolysed. Type example of peptidase family C26. Formerly EC 3.4.22.12</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1">Arabidopsis contains three genes coding for &amp;gamma;-folylpolyglutamate hydrolase that are tandemly arranged on chromosome 1. The cDNA encoding &amp;gamma;-folylpolyglutamate hydrolase (GGH1) has been identified and characterized in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;.
