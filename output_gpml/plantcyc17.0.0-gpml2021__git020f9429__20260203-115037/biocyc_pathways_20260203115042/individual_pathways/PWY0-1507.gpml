  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General information&lt;/b&gt;: |FRAME: BIOTIN biotin| is a water soluble, heterocyclic cofactor for a small number of enzymes that facilitate the transfer of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during carboxylation, decarboxylation and transcarboxylation reactions involved in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism |CITS: [SHELLHAMMER90][11706201][15012185]|. The biotin-requiring enzymes identified so far (including |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX acetyl-CoA carboxylase|, |FRAME: CPLX-6021 CPLX-6021|, |FRAME: CPLX-5203 propionyl-CoA carboxylase|, and |FRAME: CPLX-6001 pyruvate carboxylase|) play essential roles in cell metabolism |CITS: [8676868]|. Biotin may also have functions in metabolism other than its mere catalytic role as an enzyme cofactor. It has been shown that biotin also carries out non-catalytic functions in the expression of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; biotin-auxotroph mutants, by modulating and regulating gene expression |CITS: [12644697]|. Biotin biosynthesis is found in plants, bacteria (see |FRAME: BIOTIN-SYNTHESIS-PWY BIOTIN-SYNTHESIS-PWY|) and certain fungi. Although animals and most fungi cannot synthesize their own biotin, a daily intake is required for normal growth and development |CITS: [11322938]|. The biotin biosynthetic pathway has been explored in detail in bacteria (|FRAME:BIOTIN-SYNTHESIS-PWY BIOTIN-SYNTHESIS-PWY|). The ongoing success in sequencing whole genomes from other organisms has provided evidence that the general steps in bacterial biotin synthesis are conserved in plants |CITS: [11322938]|. &lt;b&gt;About this pathway&lt;/b&gt;: The biotin pathway has been investigated using biotin-auxotroph mutants of bacteria and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. In Arabidopsis it could be shown that two enzymes correspond to certain mutations &lt;i&gt;bio1&lt;/i&gt; which has been shown to encode the biotin biosynthetic enzyme 7, 8-diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase |CITS: [8676868]| and &lt;i&gt;bio2&lt;/i&gt; which encodes for the biotin synthase |CITS: [8680961]|. Biotin synthase is regarded as a key enzyme of the pathway. Despite of extensive studies the catalytic mechanism of this last step remains enigmatic and all the components involved in the reaction are not known yet. The reaction involves the insertion of a sulfur atom between the C 6 and C 9 of the imidazolidone ring of dethiobiotin and requires &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet) and a physiological reduction system to assemble the thiophene ring of biotin |CITS: [0009501126]|. During the reaction a radical species is generated by the reductive cleavage of AdoMet to introduce sulfur into dethiobiotin |CITS: [11322938][12714594]|. The source of the sulfur in plants is not yet established but it has been proposed that biotin synthase itself may act as immediate sulfur donor hence proposing that biotin synthase is a reactant as well as a catalyst |CITS: [9920791]|. However, the biotin synthase activity could be clearly demonstrated in Arabidopsis utilizing the synthase and accessory proteins from &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [11706201]|. It has been shown that mitochondrial components are necessary for the function of the enzyme, acting similar to the flavodoxin reduction system found in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. The mitochondrial components identified were adrenodoxin, adrenodoxin reductase and cystein desulfurase (Nfs1) which proved to be essential for the plant biotin synthase reaction and accommodates the cellular location of the enzyme |CITS: [12714594]|. While the plant pathway is very similar to the bacterial one, a stable intermediate (9-mercaptodethiobiotin) was identified from cell cultures of lavender which differs from the pathway found in bacterial cells |CITS: [8223585]|. This compound is involved in the last step in biotin biosynthesis. The reaction, catalyzed by biotin synthase, is very complex and not yet fully understood. Furthermore, biotin synthase is the only enzyme of the pathway which has been investigated in plants on the molecular level |CITS: [8680961][9428635][11706201][12714594]|. The enzyme catalyzing the first committed step of the biotin biosynthesis, i.e. 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (AtbioF) is localised in the cytosol and not in the mitochondrium as is the last enzyme of the pathway biotin synthase. That strongly indicates that this pathway is compartimentalized which is also in contrast to the bacterial variant |CITS: [16299174]|. This complex spatial organization of biotin metabolism is comparable to the tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis (|FRAME:PWY-3742 tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis II|), another vitamin synthesized only by plants and microorganisms.</Description>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">An embryo-lethal mutant of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, referred to as &lt;i&gt;bio1&lt;/i&gt;, can be rescued by the addition of biotin and dethiobiotin to arrested embryos . The biotin-auxotroph plants produced phenotypically normal seeds with fertile flowers when treated with biotin &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; as well as when grown in soil. It has been shown that &lt;i&gt;bio1&lt;/i&gt; embryos contain virtually no biotin indicating a biochemical defect in biotin synthesis rather than a developmental arrest in embryonic lethals |CITS: [Shellhammer90]|. The fact that arrested embryos could be rescued by biotin, dethiobiotin and 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA) but not by 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA) points to a metabolic block prior to the conversion of DAPA to dethiobiotin. The mutant is therefore defective in the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase  |CITS: [Shellhammer90]| . This enzyme is actually encoded by a bi-functional BIO1-BIO3 locus that has two genes required for two sequential steps in the biotin biosynthesis pathway .</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (AdoMet, SAM) is a sulfonium compound in which each of the carbons attached to the sulfur is activated toward nucleophilic attack. It is the most common methyl group donor for methyltransferase enzymes. In addition, AdoMet is cleaved reductively by a large number of iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes (known as radical SAM or radical AdoMet enzymes) to produce |FRAME: CPD-15400|, which they use to activate their substrates. Another major role of AdoMet is in polyamine biosynthesis, where it is decarboxylated by |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.50|, to form |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE|, which serves as a propylamine group donor. AdoMet is formed by |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.6| and bears an &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; configuration at the sulfur atom. The chiral sulfonium of AdoMet spontaneously racemizes under physiological conditions to form a mixture of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; isomers. This results in reduced activity, as the |FRAME: CPD0-2554 &quot;&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; isomer&quot;| is not accepted as a substrate for AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases |CITS: [12419350]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: BIOTIN &quot;Biotin&quot;| is a water soluble, heterocyclic cofactor for a small number of enzymes that facilitate the transfer of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during carboxylation, decarboxylation and transcarboxylation reactions involved in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism |CITS: [SHELLHAMMER90][11706201][15012185]|. The biotin-requiring enzymes identified so far (including |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|, |FRAME: CPLX66-17|, |FRAME: CPLX-5203|, and |FRAME: CPLX-6001|) play essential roles in cell metabolism |CITS: [8676868]|. Humans and other mammals cannot synthesize biotin and thus must obtain it from exogenous sources via intestinal absorption. Biotin was first discovered at the turn of the 20th century as a yeast growth factor, and was named bios |CITS: [Wildiers01]|. 30 years later, the compound was purified from egg yolk by Koegl and Toennis |CITS: [Koegl36]|. In a completely unrelated research, Gyoergy and his colleagues discovered biotin in liver in 1931, and isolated it in 1941. They named it vitamin H (for the German word for skin: Haut) |CITS: [Vigneaud41]|. At the same time, another group, which was working on &lt;i&gt;Rhizobia&lt;/i&gt; bacteria, also identified it as an essential cofactor, which they named coenzyme R |CITS: [Allison38]|. Already in 1933, Gyoergy suggested that coenzyme R, bios and vitamin H were all the same molecule. The structure of biotin was solved in 1941 -1942 |CITS: [Vigneaud41B][Melville42]|. In 1949 the first evidence was published demonstrating the biochemical role of biotin in carboxylation reactions, |CITS: [Lardy49]|, and in 1958 it was suggested that biotin was probably associated with an enzyme |CITS: [13560478]|. Shortly after this finding, Lynen et al |CITS: [Lynen61]| described biotin&apos;s biological function as a cofactor in the biotin-dependent carboxylases. (This historical background is adapted from |CITS: [12658511]|).</Comment>
