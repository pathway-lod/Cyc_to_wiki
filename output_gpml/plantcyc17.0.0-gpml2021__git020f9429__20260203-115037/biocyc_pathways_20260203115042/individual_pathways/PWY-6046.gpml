      <Comment>Dimethylsulfoniopropanoate (DMSP), an osmolyte of many marine algae and certain plants |CITS: [15181109]|, is also the main source for |FRAME: CPD-7670| (DMS) in the marine environment |CITS: [12450799]|. It was first identified in 1948 in the red alga |FRAME: TAX-1261582| |CITS: [18101461]|, and is found in the highest concentrations in |FRAME: TAX-2864| (dinoflagellates) and |FRAME: TAX-2608131| (haptophytes). However, DMSP is produced by many more organisms including diatoms, green algae, some higher plants like |FRAME: TAX-4547| (sugarcane) and the coastal angiosperms |FRAME: TAX-15853| and |FRAME: TAX-101473|, bacteria, and some coral species |CITS: [31231779]|. Marine phytoplankton synthesize DMSP not only as an osmolyte, but also as a predator deterrent and an antioxidant |CITS: [17068264]|. The degradation of DMSP to DMS and subsequent exchange of DMS across the ocean-atmosphere boundary is the main natural source of sulfur to the atmosphere.</Comment>

      <Comment>|FRAME: CPD-7670 Dimethylsulfide| (DMS) is a major contributor to the total sulfur emissions to the atmosphere from land and the ocean. In marine, estuarine, and salt marsh systems, the main source of DMS is the degradation of |FRAME: SS-DIMETHYL-BETA-PROPIOTHETIN| (DMSP), an osmolyte of many marine algae and certain plants |CITS: [15181109]|. DMSP is readily degraded in a variety of biological systems, including bacterial cultures, salt marsh sediments, and seawater samples containing algae and zooplankton |CITS: [16347732]|. There are two main routes for DMSP degradation, leading to formation of either |FRAME: CPD-7670| or |FRAME: CPD-7672|. Other sources for DMS include the reduction of |FRAME: DMSO|, the methylation of |FRAME: CPD-7671|, and the degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids. DMS, which is very volatile, is exchanged freely between the ocean and the atmosphere, and is considered the main natural source of sulfur to the atmosphere. Once in the troposphere, DMS is oxidized to |FRAME: SULFATE| and |FRAME: CPD-3746|, which attract water and promote cloud formation and thus influence the climate |CITS: [Charlson87]|. However, up to 90% of the DMS in the ocean is degraded biologically |CITS: [Kiene90]|. DMS is toxic, and attempts to isolate in pure culture DMS-degrading organisms that can use it as the sole carbon and energy source have been often unsuccessful due to this toxicity. However, several organisms capable of degerading DMS have been isolated over the years. Aerobic bacterial DMS oxidation has been demonstrated in organisms from a few taxonomic domains, including Thiobacillus sp. strain MS1 |CITS: [Sivela80]|, |FRAME: ORG-5989| |CITS: [Kanagawa82] [Kanagawa86][2930168][Tanji89][Gould92]|, |FRAME: ORG-6053| |CITS: [1872604][8285684]|, |FRAME: ORG-6050| |CITS: [Debont81]|, |FRAME: ORG-6052| |CITS:[3767349][Suylen86][Suylen87][Smith88a]| and |FRAME:TAX-392484| |CITS:[16535680][17322322]|. Anaerobic degradation of DMS has been documented by methanogens |CITS: [11073950]| (see |FRAME: PWY-5258|) and by sulfate-reducing bacteria |CITS: [8074524]|.</Comment>
