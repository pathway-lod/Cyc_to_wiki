  <Description>The conversion of |FRAME:CPD-6442 methylsalicylate| to |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| is part of the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plants. Plant defense is based on the interaction between pathogen and host on the molecular level, often referred to as gene-for-gene interaction |CITS:[2088175]| which elicits a response such as ion flux changes, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or the release/production of |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate|, nitric oxide and increased expression of pathogen related (PR) genes |CITS:[11459065]|. The hydroxybenzoate |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| has been recognized as a stress hormone that functions as a signal in the SAR pathway in plants |CITS:[7858199]|. It has been proposed to be involved in the activation of plant defensive actions at both the infection as well as distal, uninfected sites, hence acting systemically |CITS:[Dempsey99]|. Plants attacked by pathogens often accumulate high amounts of |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| |CITS:[17746925]|. |FRAME:CPD-110 Salicylate| can be metabolized in plants in various ways and may occur as a methylated |CITS:[Shulaev97] [9489012]| (see |FRAME:PWY18C3-22 methylsalicylate biosynthesis|) or glucose conjugated compound |CITS:[12297650]| (compare also with |FRAME:PWY18C3-21 phenylpropanoid volatiles glycoconjugation (tomato)|). The expression of pathogen related (PR) genes in tobacco when infected with the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is similar to PR gene expressions after treatment with exogenous |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| |CITS:[18631626]|. At the same time levels of |FRAME:CPD-6442 methylsalicylate| rise up in response to pathogen invasion |CITS:[Shulaev97] [Seskar98]|. Aside from pathogen infections systemic acquired resistance (SAR) has been reported to be induced by a number of chemicals such as the above mentioned |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| but also the synthetic compound |FRAME:CPD-19219 acibenzolar-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-methyl| |CITS:[8758979 ] [Ishii99]| and at least for local resistance |FRAME:CPD-19222 2,2,2,2&apos;-tetra-fluoroacetophenone| |CITS:[20687805] [19131332]|. The former is widely used in agriculture because of its low toxicological impact on plants compared to commercially used pesticides |CITS:[Friedrich96] [8624439]|. The plant immune system is fine-tuned to attacks of pathogens and may respond directly or indirectly in various ways, for instance in form of a hypersensitive response (HR) |CITS:[17108957]|. There are still many open questions regarding the SAR immune response in plants but a clearer picture of the process has been obtained over the last years (reviewed in |CITS:[7858199] [Vidhyasekaran15]|). Although |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| has been reported to be involved in many developmental processes in plants including thermogenesis |CITS:[17834449]| and stresses of biotic or abiotic nature the main focus of research was upon its role in plant immune responses and respective signaling pathways. The mechanism through which |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| operates in the SAR immune response appears to be via |FRAME:CPD-6442 methylsalicylate|, which functions as a mobile signal in the phloem |CITS:[17916738]| and is re-converted to |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| at the target issues by the action of the methylsalicylate esterase. The released |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| then initiates the SAR response and induces the expression of NPR genes |CITS:[15337097]|. The latter, particularly NPR1 might be induced via redox changes |CITS:[12837250]| and has also been shown to interact with other NPR genes |CITS:[22785561] [22699612]|. However, not all immune responses in plants are upregulated in the same way. Some defense related pathways are responsive to |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| but independent of NPR1 |CITS:[19820324] [21535470]|. Consequently, |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| may not act as an receptor in the traditional sense but through many targets in various developmental processes related to biochemistry, physiology and pathology in plants and animals (|CITS:[14673096] [25584724]| and summarized in |CITS:[27303403]|). The purified methylsalicylate esterase from &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana tabacum&lt;/i&gt; (SABP2) |CITS:[12223676]| was studied with respect to local and systemic resistance against the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) |CITS:[14673096]|. Biochemical and structural research of the protein revealed the high affinity towards |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| which allows the regulation of the enzyme at distal, unaffected tissues. The catalytic triad characteristic for the &amp;alpha;/&amp;beta; hydrolase superfamily (Ser-81, His-238, and Asp-210) was present in SABP2 with Ser-81 being determined as essential for esterase activity |CITS:[15668381]|. The SABP2 encoded protein was shown to also catalyze the conversion of |FRAME:CPD-19219 acibenzolar-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-methyl| to |FRAME:CPD-19221 acibenzolar|. Interestingly, SABP2 silenced plants treated with |FRAME:CPD-19219 acibenzolar-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-methyl| (ASM) were unable to induce the expression of pathogenesis related (PR) genes, especially PR-1 whereas the same plants treated with the esterase product, i.e. |FRAME:CPD-19221 acibenzolar| elicit a SAR response. This indicates that the SABP2 encoded methylsalicylate esterase does not act as receptor in the SAR immune response but rather as a biochemical mediator in the SAR signaling pathway |CITS:[20621100]|. In contrast to tobacco which has very low concentrations of |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| in non-induced tissues, potato (&lt;i&gt;Solanum tuberosum&lt;/i&gt;) contains naturally rather high amounts of |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| |CITS:[Coquoz95]|. Nevertheless, the methylsalicyl esterase (MES1) characterized from potato exhibited not only comparable biochemical properties but also, via its catalyzed reaction to form |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| from |FRAME:CPD-6442 methylsalicylate|, elicited corresponding immune responses in this plant. In general, silencing of MES1 in &lt;i&gt;Solanum tuberosum&lt;/i&gt; resulted in a different SAR, increased the level of |FRAME:CPD-6442 methylsalicylate| at induced leaves under concurrent decreased levels of |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| at distal, untreated tissues and diminished the expression of pathogen-related (PR) genes, e.g. PR-1 |CITS:[20687805]|.</Description>

      <Comment source="O-28, hartmut">Utilizing the methylsalicylate esterase (SABP2) from tobacco as probe, the ortholog gene for &lt;i&gt;Solanum tuberosum&lt;/i&gt; was identified by screening a expressed sequence tag (EST) database. The cDNA (MES1) was recombinant expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and biochemically characterized. It could be demonstrated that the MES1 encoded protein was able to catalyze the conversion of |FRAME:CPD-6442 methylsalicylate| to |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate|. The MES1 gene shares a high homology on the amino acid level with SABP2 (75.6%) and also possesses the catalytic triad (Ser-82, His-240, and Asp-211) characteristic for the &amp;alpha;/&amp;beta; hydrolase superfamily of enzymes . The molecular function of the MES1 encoded protein as methylsalicylate esterase was also demonstrated in a complementation analysis in which MES1 from &lt;i&gt;Solanum tuberosum&lt;/i&gt; was able to restore the low concentrations of |FRAME:CPD-6442 methylsalicylate|, |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| (including |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| glucosides) and the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) response of SABP2-silenced transgenic &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana tabacum&lt;/i&gt; plants to standard values found in the wild type. In general, silencing of MES1 in &lt;i&gt;Solanum tuberosum&lt;/i&gt; elicited a different SAR, increased the level of |FRAME:CPD-6442 methylsalicylate| at induced leaves under concurrent decreased levels of |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| at distal, untreated tissues and diminished the expression of pathogen-related (PR) genes, e.g. PR-1 .</Comment>

MES9 has higher activity with MeSA than MeIAA or MeJA &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, it can complement the systemic acquired resistance (SAR)-deficient phenotype of tobacco plants with reduced SABP2 expression. And, its transcript levels are up-regulated in response to pathogen attack. All of these suggest that MES9 likely plays a role in SA metabolism and SAR responses &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; .</Comment>

      <Comment source="O-28, hartmut">A partially purified protein from leaves of &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana tabacum&lt;/i&gt; was found to display a high affinity towards |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| with an apparent dissociation constant of 90 nM. The protein was named salicylic acid-binding protein (SABP2) and was studied with respect to immune responses of plants such as the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) . Further studies reported the purification and biochemical characterization of SABP2 indicating a molecular function as lipase/esterase involved in the signaling pathway of SAR. The encoding gene was recombinant expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, purified to homogeneity and subjected to biochemical assays. It could be demonstrated that the silencing of the SABP2 gene resulted in a strong progression of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) indicating that the SABP2 encoded protein was required for local and systemic resistance against this virus . The catalytic properties of the SABP2 encoded protein showed that the protein exhibits |FRAME:CPD-6442 methylsalicylate| esterase activity which was significantly inhibited by the product of the reaction |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate|. The highly purified protein was crystallized and its 3D structure in the absence and presence of |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| (SA) investigated. The structural data of the protein confirmed its affiliation with the &amp;alpha;/&amp;beta; hydrolase superfamily of enzymes as proposed earlier (), showed the existence of two domains, a core domain and a cap domain with the C-terminal of the core domain harboring the active site of the enzyme and indicated that the protein probably existed as a homodimer. The catalytic triad characteristic for the &amp;alpha;/&amp;beta; hydrolase superfamily (Ser-81, His-238, and Asp-210) was present in SABP2 with Ser-81 being determined as essential for esterase activity . In addition, the SABP2 encoded methylsalicylate esterase was also active with |FRAME:CPD-19219 acibenzolar-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-methyl| (ASM) forming |FRAME:CPD-19221 acibenzolar| in the process. The synthetic |FRAME:CPD-19219 acibenzolar-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-methyl| is an even better inhibitor than |FRAME:CPD-110 salicylate| of the reaction . The former is widely used in agriculture to elicit defense against pathogens and also appears to activate the SAR signal pathway |CITS:[Friedrich96]|. SABP2 silenced plants treated with ASM do not induce the expression of pathogenesis related (PR) genes, especially PR-1 whereas the same plants treated with the esterase product |FRAME:CPD-19221 acibenzolar| elicit a SAR response. This indicates that the SABP2 encoded methylsalicylate esterase does not act as receptor for SAR but rather as a biochemical mediator in the SAR signaling pathway .</Comment>
