  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General Information:&lt;/b&gt; At the time of this review, 136 fully characterized gibberellins (starting with GA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; |CITS:[5638147]|) have been identified in more than a hundred vascular plant species, seven bacteria and seven fungi |CITS:[SPONSEL04],[11986764]|. Of these gibberellins only a few have biological activity. Many of the GAs identified early in the history of the discovery of these hormones are the ones which possess the highest biological activity. These include GA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. GA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the most active GA for stem elongation in &lt;i&gt;Zea mays&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&lt;/i&gt;, while GA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the most active GA in Cucurbitaceae and in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. GA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (gibberellic acid), on the other hand, has been identified in more than 40 plants and is the major GA in the fungus &lt;i&gt;Gibberella fujikuroi&lt;/i&gt;. GA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is used commercially to promote seed germination, stem elongation and fruit growth. In &lt;i&gt;Lolium&lt;/i&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; have been shown to enhance flowering, whilst GA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; enhanced stem elongation |CITS:[12475622]|. Gibberellins are diterpenes which, in higher plants, are synthesized in the plastids from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). They all have either 19 or 20 carbon units grouped into either four or five ring systems (see |FRAME:C20SKELETON| and |FRAME:C19SKELETON|, respectively). The fifth ring is a lactone ring. GAs containing a tetracyclic &lt;i&gt;ent&lt;/i&gt;-gibberellane structure (|FRAME:C20SKELETON|) are called C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;-GAs, whereas GAs containing a pentacyclic 20-nor-&lt;i&gt;ent&lt;/i&gt;-gibberellane structure (|FRAME:C19SKELETON|) are called C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;-GAs. C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;-GAs do not usually have biological activity but can be metabolized to active C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;-GAs (note that not all C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;-GAs are bioactive). Gibberellins are believed to be synthesized in young tissues of the shoot and also the developing seed. It is uncertain whether young root tissues also produce gibberellins. There is also some evidence that leaves may be the source of some biosynthesis.Active gibberellins show many physiological effects, each depending on the type of gibberellin present as well as the species of plant. Some of the physiological processes stimulated by gibberellins are: i) stimulation of stem elongation by stimulating cell division and elongation, ii) stimulation of bolting/flowering in response to long days, iii) interruption of seed dormancy in plants requiring stratification or light to induce germination, iv) stimulation of enzyme production (&amp;alpha;-amylases) in germinating cereal grains for mobilization of seed reserves, v) induction of maleness in dioecious flowers (sex expression), vi) parthenocarpic (seedless) fruit development, and vii) delay of senescence in leaves and citrus fruits. Certain commercial chemicals which are used to stunt growth do so in part because they block the synthesis of gibberellins. Some of these chemicals are |FRAME:CPD-6966|, |FRAME:CPD-6967|, |FRAME:CPD-6968|, |FRAME: CPD-4022| and |FRAME:CPD-6970| (more inhibitors of GA biosynthesis can be found in |CITS:[SPONSEL04]|). During active growth, the plant will maintain gibberellin homeostasis by metabolizing most gibberellins by rapid hydroxylation to inactive conjugates. Active |FRAME:GIBBERELLIN| is degraded much slower which helps to explain the symptoms observed in the disease bakanae caused by the rice pathogen &lt;i&gt;Gibberella fujikuroi&lt;/i&gt;. This pathogen produces large amounts of GA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; which it secretes. Inactive conjugates might be stored or translocated via the phloem and xylem before their release (activation) at the proper time and in the proper tissue. &lt;b&gt;This Pathway:&lt;/b&gt; GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, the first true gibberellin is synthesized in plastids (see |FRAME:PWY-5034|). It is then further oxidized in the cytosol to a wide range of gibberellins. Depending on the sequence of hydroxylation at the 3&amp;beta;- and 13-positions, parallel pathways branch from GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to the C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;-GAs, the number and prevalence of these branch pathways varying from species to species. The presence of the early 13-hydroxylation branch pathway, a pathway originating from GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; GA&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt; and leading to the hydroxylated C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; GA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has been demonstrated in many species including maize, rice, pea and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; |CITS:[10557253],[11117879],[9154988],[7630935]|. &lt;b&gt;Enzymes:&lt;/b&gt; The reactions of this pathway are catalyzed by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. The first step of this pathway is performed by a gibberellin 13-hydroxylase which to date has not been identified in any of the plant species studied. This elusive enzyme allows for the conversion of GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to GA&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt;. The following enzyme of this pathway, gibberellin 20-oxidase, catalyzes the removal of C-20, thereby forming the C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;-skeleton in GA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;. This enzyme performs the sequential oxidation of C-20 to the alcohol and aldehyde, followed by the removal of the C atom through formation of the 4, 10-lactone ring. The alcohol intermediate (GA&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;) must be in its open lactone form (free alcohol) to be catalyzed by the enzyme. It is however extracted from plants in its closed &amp;delta;-lactone form (|FRAME:GIBBERELLIN-44|) which is no longer oxidized by GA20-oxidases. Although it is not certain whether this form occurs naturally &lt;i&gt;in planta&lt;/i&gt; or is an artifact of the extraction procedure, it is interesting to note that spinach cell-free extracts contain an enzyme able to catalyze the conversion of the &amp;delta;-lactone form to its free alcohol form |CITS:[WARD97]|. Additional oxidation reactions leading to the formation of growth-active GAs such as GA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are performed by gibberellin 3-oxidases which, depending on the species, are varyingly regiospecific |CITS:[SPONSEL04]|.</Description>

      <Comment>The &lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt; (wheat) &lt;i&gt;GA20ox1&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes for a gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase (TaGA20OX1). Cell lysates of &lt;i&gt;E.coli&lt;/i&gt; expressing &lt;i&gt;GA20ox1&lt;/i&gt; could catalyze the 20-oxidation of primarily GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt; . However, more detailed investigation of the enzyme&apos;s activity showed it could used GA&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; as substrates, albeit with a much reduced efficiency. The enzyme was purified and shown to have K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.07 &amp;mu;M and 13.8 nmol.min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), 0.06 &amp;mu;M and 8.7 nmol.min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (GA&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt;), 0.37 &amp;mu;M and 11.4 nmol.min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (GA&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;), 3.99 &amp;mu;M and 80 nmol.min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (GA&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;), 0.82 &amp;mu;M and 87.7 nmol.min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (GA&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;) and 8.64 &amp;mu;M and 69 nmol.min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (GA&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;) .

      <Comment source="PMN, dreher">GA3ox1 is a multifunctional protein involved in gibberellin metabolism in rice. It can act as a gibberellin 3&amp;beta;-hydroxylase (for example, by catalyzing the conversion of |FRAME: CPD-15217 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;| to |FRAME: GIBBERELLIN gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|)), as a 2,3-desaturase (by catalzying the transformation of |FRAME: CPD1F-140 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;| to |FRAME: CPD-15217 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;|), and as a gibberellin 2&amp;beta;-hydroxylase by catalyzing the conversion of |FRAME: CPD1F-139 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| to |FRAME: CPD-204 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; . It is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family of proteins. GA3ox1 transcript levels are highest in unopened flowers .</Comment>

The conversion of GA&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt; led to the production of GA&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt; as well as small amounts of GA&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;. At the time of this review, this enzyme has not been further characterized.</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, PMN, dreher">CYP714B1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes that catalyzes the formation of |FRAME: CPD-659 GA53| (gibberellin A53) from |FRAME: CPD1F-95 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;| in the first committed step of the |FRAME: PWY-5035 early C13 hydroxylation gibberellin biosynthesis pathway| . When this recombinant His-tagged protein is tested against several other potential gibberellins and gibberellin precursors, including |FRAME: CPD1F-132 ent-kaurenoic acid|, |FRAME: CPD1F-134 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;|, and |FRAME: CPD1F-137 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|, using the same yeast microsomal fraction assay CYP714B1 shows no activity . A closely related enzyme, CYP714B2, catalyzes the same reaction in rice and a &lt;i&gt;cyp714b1 cyb714b2&lt;/i&gt; double mutant has reduced levels of several GA compounds found downstream of |FRAME: CPD1F-95 GA12| in the |FRAME: PWY-5035 early C13 hydroxylation gibberellin biosynthesis pathway|, including |FRAME: CPD-695 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt;| and the bioactive |FRAME: CPD1F-139 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|. It also has increased levels of the compounds produced in an alternative |FRAME: PWY-5070 non-C13 hydroxylation pathway|, including |FRAME: CPD1F-134 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;| and |FRAME: CPD1F-137 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|. However, some 13-hydroxylated GAs can be detected in this double mutant, suggesting that additional enzymes might also catalyze gibberellin C13 oxidation in rice. This is further supported by the observation of soluble gibberellin 13-oxidase activity in other plant species |CITS: 16664991| while CYP714B1 is expected to be a membrane-bound protein . In addition, there is some evidence of multifunctional GA-metabolizing enzymes that have weak C13-oxidase activity, such as |FRAME: MONOMER-11644 TaGA3ox2| in wheat . CYP714B1 transcript levels increase following treatment with the bioactive GAs |FRAME: CPD1F-137 gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;| and |FRAME: GIBBERELLIN gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;| .</Comment>

      <Comment>The gibberellin 20-oxidase encoded by the &lt;i&gt;Cucurbita maxima GA20OX&lt;/i&gt; gene (isolated from a cDNA library of developing cotyledons) was expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. The bacterial cell lysate containing the recombinant GA 20-oxidase efficiently converts GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; into GA&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, and GA&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as GA&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt; into GA&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; . The conversion of GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt; led to a poor production of GA&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively . This enzyme was purified to homogeneity and shown to require Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, 2-oxoglutarate, and to have an absolute requirement for ascorbate, known to be involved in the reduction of FeO&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; . Pumpkin GA 20-oxidase belongs to a class of plant dioxygenases .</Comment>

      <Comment>The &lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt; (wheat) &lt;i&gt;G3ox2&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes for a gibberellin (GA) 3-oxidase (TaGA3ox2). Cell lysates of &lt;i&gt;E.coli&lt;/i&gt; expressing &lt;i&gt;GA3ox2&lt;/i&gt; could catalyze the 3&amp;beta;-hydroxylation of a broad range of GAs including a) GAs with a |FRAME:C19SKELETON| (GA&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;), b) GAs with a |FRAME:C20SKELETON| (GA&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;), and c) 2,3-unsaturated GAs (GA&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and 2,3-didehydroGA&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) . TaGA3ox2 showed no activity in the presence of the C&lt;SUB&gt;20&lt;/SUB&gt; GAs GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;. Interestingly, although TaGA3ox2 functions mainly as a 3&amp;beta;-hydroxylase, it was shown to also possess 2&amp;beta;-hydroxylase, 2,3-desaturase, 2,3-epoxidase and even 13-hydroxylase activities . Indeed, GA&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; and 2,3-dehydroGA&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; were converted to a variety of substrates (see enzymatic reactions below for detail). The enzyme was purified and shown to have K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values of 1.00 &amp;mu;M and 20.3 nmol.min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (GA&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) and 2.02 &amp;mu;M and 16.6 nmol.min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (GA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;) . &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Two more isoforms of TaGA2ox2-1 have been described which all share the same catalytic activity . They are encoded by the following genes: |FRAME:G-9061| and |FRAME:G-9062|.</Comment>

      <Comment>An isoform of &lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&lt;/i&gt; GA 20-oxidase was expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. The bacterial cell lysate containing the recombinant GA 20-oxidase could convert GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; into GA&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as GA&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt; into GA&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; . Interestingly &lt;i&gt;Ps&lt;/i&gt;GA 20-oxidase was able to convert both GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt; very efficiently in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; and pumpkin GA 20-oxidases which preferentially convert GA&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. The high activity of GA 20-oxidases with GA&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt; may be related to the fact that, contrary to &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;, pea produces mainly 13-hydroxylated GAs, indicating that early 13-hydroxylation is the predominant pathway (although this is not necessarily true in all tissue types). At the time of this review, this enzyme has not been further characterized.</Comment>

      <Comment>The &lt;i&gt;Phaseolus coccineus GA3ox1&lt;/i&gt; gene was expressed in &lt;i&gt;E.coli&lt;/i&gt; and shown to encode for a gibberellin (GA) 3-oxidase (PcGA3OX1). Cell lysates of &lt;i&gt;E.coli&lt;/i&gt; expressing &lt;i&gt;GA3ox1&lt;/i&gt; could catalyze the 3-oxidation of GA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; to GA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. GA&lt;sub&gt;29&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; were not detected indicating that the recombinant protein does not possess any 2&amp;beta;-hydroxylase activity against GA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; to GA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; . Study of the mRNA localization of this gene during embryo development showed it is specifically found in the suspensor during the early cotyledonary stage, and in the inner layer of the integument at the cotyledonary stage .</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">The &lt;i&gt;GA4&lt;/i&gt; gene was isolated from floral apices of the &lt;i&gt;ga1-2&lt;/i&gt; mutant of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; L. Heynh. This gene was shown to encode a gibberellin 3&amp;beta;-hydroxylase (GA3OX). The recombinant GA 3&amp;beta;-oxidase was expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, the bacterial cell lysates of which was used to assess the conversion efficiency of the protein towards a number of radiolabeled gibberellins (GAs) . Of the various GAs tested GA&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; was the preferred substrate, which is consistent with the predominance of non-13-hydroxylated GAs in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. GA3OX was also shown to efficiently convert GA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; and to a lesser extent GA&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;, GA&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; and GA&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt; . Interestingly, the closed lactone form of GA&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; was hydroxylated almost as efficiently as GA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; (see reaction |FRAME:RXN-7680|), while the open lactone was a poor substrate . In general, C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;-GAs are much better substrates for GA3OX than C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;-GAs.</Comment>
