  <Description>The glycolysis pathway represented here is also known as the &apos;&lt;i&gt;Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway&lt;/i&gt;&apos;. First identified in yeast cells and mammalian tissue, it is now also seen as the &apos;central&apos; metabolic pathway in plants, and can be found, if at least in part, in all organisms. Glycolysis has evolved as a catabolic anaerobic pathway that fulfills two essential functions: i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE pyruvate|, and ii) it is an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism) because it can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules. The ultimate purpose of the pathway is to convert carbon in its reduced form in storage carbohydrates (e.g. |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, |FRAME:Starch starch| and simpler carbohydrates such as |FRAME:SUCROSE sucrose|, |FRAME:D-Glucose D-glucose| and |FRAME:D-Galactose D-galactose|). In plants, glycolysis is the predominant pathway fueling respiration (see |FRAME:TCA TCA cycle|) because, unlike animal mitochondria, plant mitochondria rarely respire fatty acids. In plants, this pathway occurs in two different subcellular locations: the cytosol and plastids, which are the sites of |FRAME:PWY-621 sucrose degradation III| and |FRAME: PWY-6724 starch degradation II|, respectively. Whereas the &lt;i&gt;plastidic&lt;/i&gt; glycolysis pathway (see |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis I|) is identical to the conventional microbial glycolysis, the &lt;i&gt;cytosolic&lt;/i&gt; pathway (i.e. this pathway) is slightly modified. These pathways can interact with one another though the action of highly selective transporters present in the inner plastid envelope |CITS:[Emes93]|. In chloroplasts in the dark, as well as in plastids of non-photosynthetic tissues, the primary function of |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis I| is the degradation of |FRAME:Starch starch| to generate carbon skeletons, reductants and ATP for anabolic pathways such as that of |FRAME:PWY-4381 fatty acid biosynthesis initiation I| via |FRAME:PYRUVDEHYD-PWY acetyl-CoA biosynthesis (from pyruvate)|. In the cytosol, the same products are generated from the degradation of |FRAME:SUCROSE sucrose|. The pathway starts with |FRAME:GLC-6-P &amp;beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate|, which is made available from a variety of sources (in the plant plastids, it results from |FRAME: PWY-6724 starch degradation II|). The first committed step of glycolysis is the reversible conversion of |FRAME:GLC-6-P &amp;beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate| into |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P D-fructose-6-phosphate| by an hexose phosphate isomerase, which changes the pyranose configuration of glucose into the furanose configuration of fructose. The second step is catalyzed by a phosphofructokinase in the presence of |FRAME:ATP ATP|; this step is irreversible (in the cytosol of plants, see |FRAME:PWY-621 sucrose degradation III|, an alternative enzyme uses |FRAME:PPI diphosphate| instead of ATP). The third step is catalyzed by an aldolase which cleaves |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE fructose-1,6-bisphosphate| into interconvertable (they are keto-enol tautomers) two three-carbon fragments: |FRAME:GAP D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate| and |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE dihydroxyacetone phosphate|. The interconversion of these tautomers is facilitated by a triose phosphate isomerase. The following reaction, which adds one phosphate residue to |FRAME:GAP D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate| to form |FRAME:DPG 1,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate|, is freely reversible and requires |FRAME:NAD NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;| and |FRAME:Pi phosphate|. The next step releases one molecule of ATP during the conversion of |FRAME:DPG 1,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate| into |FRAME:G3P 3-phospho-D-glycerate| by a Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate kinase. The next step requires little energy change and leads to the reversible transfer of a phosphate group from the 3- to the 2-hydroxyl group of glycerate, leading to the formation of |FRAME:2-PG 2-phospho-D-glycerate|. The removal of a molecule of water by an enolase in the presence of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; converts |FRAME:2-PG 2-phospho-D-glycerate| into |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE phosphoenolpyruvate|. The final step of glycolysis involves the ketolization of |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE phosphoenolpyruvate| to |FRAME:PYRUVATE pyruvate| by a pyruvate kinase, leading to the release of a molecule of ATP. In the cytosol, there are two alternative reactions to the plastidic pathway: EC 2.7.1.90 and EC 1.2.1.9. The former represents an alternative to EC 2.7.1.11; this reaction utilizes |FRAME:PPI diphosphate| rather than ATP to convert |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P D-fructose-6-phosphate| to |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE fructose-1,6-bisphosphate|. The plant cytosol lacks soluble inorganic alkaline pyrophosphatases (PPiases) and, consequently, contains higher concentrations of |FRAME:PPI diphosphate| (up to 0.3 mM |CITS:[WEINER87]|). It has been proposed that the utilization of pyrophosphate rather than that of ATP in glycolysis is favored under nutritional &lt;i&gt;Pi&lt;/i&gt; deprivation or oxygen deficiency |CITS:[DAVIES93],[15012287]|. The latter reaction, EC 1.2.1.9, provides a bypass between |FRAME:GAP D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate| and |FRAME:G3P 3-phospho-D-glycerate|, which allows for their conversion without phosphorylation by a non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenase |CITS:[15012287],[16927206]|. This reaction produces |FRAME:NADPH NADPH| but not |FRAME:ATP ATP|. The overall process, which requires the initial investment of one molecule of ATP to produce |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE fructose-1,6-bisphosphate|, yields four molecules of ATP and two molecules of |FRAME:NADH NADH| for every molecule of hexose fed to the system. The fate of the final product of glycolysis, |FRAME:PYRUVATE pyruvate|, depends on the state of the oxygen supply and can be consumed, for example, by the |FRAME:TCA TCA cycle| via the formation |FRAME:ACETYL-COA acetyl-CoA| in aerobic conditions, or degraded to ethanol or lactate under anaerobic conditions (see |FRAME:PWY-3801 sucrose degradation to ethanol and lactate (anaerobic)|).</Description>

      <Comment>Enolases catalyze the freely reversible interconversion between 2-phosphoglycerate (2PGA) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). This enolase has an absolute requirement for divalent metal ions (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; displaying the highest activity increase; K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value of 1.4 mM). Another enolase was isolated from spinach chloroplasts. Both enolases share identical pH optima of 7.5 in the direction of PEP formation but have distinct optima for the reverse reaction of 2PGA formation: 7.8 for the cytosolic isozyme and 6.0 for the plastidic isozyme . A K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; value of 0.4 mM was determined for the competitive inhibitor 2-phosphoglycolate.</Comment>

      <Comment source="THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, tissier">Two enzymes with ATP-dependent fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase activity (PFK) resolved into distinct peaks by FPLC were isolated from clarified extracts of &lt;i&gt;Musa acuminata&lt;/i&gt; fruits (which had been treated with |FRAME:ETHYLENE-CMPD| and allowed to ripen for five days at 25°C) . The first peak named PFK I (this enzyme) was purified 375-fold to a final specific activity of 6.0 units.mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Both isoforms (PFK I and PFK II) were unstable and could not be purified beyond gel filtration FPLC. However, since the unpure preparations were devoid of contaminating activities (listed in ), the preparations were considered suitable for further kinetic characterization. No activity was detected when |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| was replaced by |FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:CPD-448| or |FRAME:FRU1P|. Positive cooperativity was demonstrated for |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|, whereas ATP binding followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics . Alternative nucleoside triphosphates can be used in place of ATP, but, when ADP, UDP or PPi were used, no activity was detected . This peak is thought to correspond to the plastidic form of the enzyme.</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">This enzyme appears to be important for allowing seedlings to make use of seed energy stores before they can become autotrophic . pdTPI had an activity of 32.2 nmol min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; when assayed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; . A ptPDI mutant with reduced transcript levels (SALK_152526) is severely stunted in growth. The seeds germinate at a rate comparable to wild type seeds but they begin to show aberrant phenotypes 3 to 4 days post-germination. Their cotyledons are paler and their primary roots are shorter than in wild type seedlings. The mutants have fewer chloroplasts per cell and the chloroplast differentiation seems to be delayed. They have fewer starch granules in their stroma. These mutants grow like wild type seedlings under dark-grown conditions. Light-grown pdtpi mutant tissue has roughly 40% less triose phosphate isomerase activity than comparable wild-type tissue. pdtpi seedlings also have elevated levels of glycerol, glycerol-3-phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and reduced levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate . The level of methylglyoxal (MG) is doubled in mutant seedlings. Total lipid content is slightly reduced, but there are notable differences between various lipid components (e.g. MGDG vs. DGDG). Overall the changes in composition indicate an enhancement of the eukaryotic galactolipid biosynthesis pathway and a decrease in the prokaryotic pathway variant. DHAP and MG accumulation in the mutant may be responsible for many of the aberrant phenotypes .</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">Glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate with concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH. Among the seven GAPDH genes in the Arabidopsis genome, two are plastidic, GAPCp1 (At1g79530) and GAPCp2 (At1g16300). In GAPCp1 and GAPCp2 double mutants, the NAD+-dependent GAPDH activity was reduced for about 25% in plastid-enriched fractions, when compared to controls. The double mutant plants had arrested root development, a phenotype could be reversed by serine supplementation in the growth medium. It suggests that the in vivo function of the plastidic GAPDH genes is to supply the 3-phosphoglycerate substrate to the phosphorylated pathway of serine biosynthesis in the plastid.</Comment>

      <Comment>A gene encoding a protein with enolase activity was isolated from fresh latex of &lt;i&gt;Hevea brasiliensis&lt;/i&gt; (rubber tree clone RRIM 600) using degenerate primers designed using conserved regions of several plant enolases . The gene was recombinantly expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. The recombinant protein was purified and assessed for activity, which was shown to be that of an enolase with a specific activity of 22 U.mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; protein. It was shown that this protein has allergenic properties: 14.5% of patients with a latex allergy possessed IgEs binding to the enolase .</Comment>

      <Comment>Recombinant glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), encoded by the &lt;i&gt;Pinus sylvestris GapCp&lt;/i&gt; gene, catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P) to 1,3-diphosphate-glycerate when expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; . Unlike most plastidic GAPDHs it is NAD-dependent (plastidic GAPDH are usually thought to be NADP-dependent). No activity was detected in the presence of either NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or NADPH .</Comment>

      <Comment source="THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, tissier">Two enzymes with phosphoglycomutase activity were isolated from the endosperm of &lt;i&gt;Ricinus communis&lt;/i&gt; (Castor oil plants) seeds harvested 30 to 40 days after anthesis; one plastidic, the other cytosolic. The plastidic protein (this protein) was purified to a specific activity of 83.8 &amp;mu;mol.min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.mg&lt;sub&gt;protein&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; . The purified enzyme could be kept at -20°C in 10 mM K-phosphate containing 20-25% glycerol for at least one month without any loss of activity. However, at pH values lower than 6.8, activity decreases rapidly, and at pH 5.5 the enzyme is completely inactivated after 8h at 4°C. By contrast, when the enzyme is kept at pH 11.0 for 24h at 4°C, only 15% of activity is lost . A 50% decrease in activity was determined after 50 min at 50°C and 8 min at 60°C (the enzyme was not protected from inactivation by |FRAME:G3P|, |FRAME:2-PG|, |FRAME:23-DIPHOSPHOGLYCERATE| or |FRAME:Pi|). A variety of metabolic effectors (listed in ) were tested to determine their influence on the enzyme activity. None of them had any effect on the enzyme. Moreover, no divalent cations were required for activity.</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, dreher">The mitochondrial isoform of citrate synthase is an important enzyme in the |FRAME: PWY-5690 TCA cycle|. It can also play a role in producing |FRAME: CIT citrate| for extrusion from the roots where it can help to improve phosphate uptake |CITS: [2491664][10427772]|. Following the original cloning of the cDNA for this gene , it was overexpressed in cultured |FRAME: TAX-4039 &lt;i&gt;Daucus carota&lt;/i&gt;| (carrot) cells. Increased citrate synthase activity was observed in cells expressing the citrate synthase gene compared to wild-type cells and cells transformed with a vector control . In these experiments, the specific activity of the Arabidopsis enzyme could not be measured separately from the endogenous carrot mitochondrial |FRAME: MONOMER-15824 citrate synthase|. But, in a cell culture expressing a high level of the Arabidopsis cDNA, the citrate synthase activity was 0.24 &amp;mu;mol (mg protein)&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; compared to 0.12 &amp;mu;mol (mg protein)&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the wild type cells . Proteomic experiments in Arabidopsis have demonstrated that this enzyme localizes in the mitochondria as would be expected for a TCA cycle participant |CITS: [10427772][11743115][14671022]|. However there is some evidence that it is associated with the cell wall fraction  and could possibly be secreted . This might have interesting implications for rhizosphere organic acid excretion and phosphate uptake.</Comment>

      <Comment>Triose phosphate isomerases catalyze the reversible isomerization of D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate. The isozyme isolated from &lt;i&gt;Pisum sativum&lt;/i&gt; seeds shows a broad pH optimum from 6.8 to 8.8. The enzyme has been shown to have many inhibitors of which phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), 2-P-glycerate, 3-P-glycerate and 2-P-glycolate were the strongest, with respective K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.1 &amp;mu;M, 6 &amp;mu;M, 50 &amp;mu;M, and 0.6 &amp;mu;M. PEP and 2-P-glycolate were shown to protect the enzyme from inactivation by either heat or chloroacetol-P |CITS:[TOMLINSON79]|.</Comment>

The enzyme was shown to be less stable than its chloroplastic counterpart (see |FRAME:MONOMER-12838||; this is in contrast to what had been observed for cucumber PFKs, where the cytosolic isoform was the more stable |CITS:[Botha88]|). The enzyme exhibits hyperbolic ATP saturation and hyperbolic |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| saturation kinetics at both pH 7.0 and pH 8.0, and its kinetics are similar at both pH values .

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">Glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate with concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH. Among the seven GAPDH genes in the Arabidopsis genome, two are plastidic, GAPCp1 (At1g79530) and GAPCp2 (At1g16300). In GAPCp1 and GAPCp2 double mutants, the NAD+-dependent GAPDH activity was reduced for about 25% in plastid-enriched fractions, when compared to controls. The double mutant plants had arrested root development, a phenotype could be reversed by serine supplementation in the growth medium. It suggests that the in vivo function of the plastidic GAPDH genes is to supply the 3-phosphoglycerate substrate to the phosphorylated pathway of serine biosynthesis in the plastid.</Comment>

      <Comment>Enolases catalyze the freely reversible interconversion between 2-phosphoglycerate (2PGA) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). This enolase has an absolute requirement for divalent metal ions (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; displaying the highest activity increase; K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value of 1.4 mM). Another enolase was isolated from spinach cytosol. Both enolases share identical pH optima of 7.5 in the direction of PEP formation but have distinct optima for the reverse reaction of 2PGA formation: 6.0 for the plastidic isozyme and 7.8 for the cytosolic isozyme . A K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; value of 0.8 mM was determined for the competitive inhibitor 2-phosphoglycolate. Although the enzyme is able to work in a reversible fashion, the acidic pH optimum in the reverse direction (PEP formation) and the relatively high PEP K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; would combine to render the plastid enolase effectively irreversible &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, perhaps contributing to the unidirectionality of the carbon flow .</Comment>

In fact two isoforms of the protein were identified through this procedure: one is cytosolic (this protein), the other chloroplastic (see |FRAME:MONOMER-12711|). The chloroplastic protein was also purified from isolated chloroplasts, allowing the exact determination of the identity of each crude extract-purified isoform |CITS:[kopke90]|. The cytosolic protein has a molecular weight of 39 kDa by size exclusion chromatography (40.7 kDa on SDS-PAGE). The protein is monomeric. Its pH optimum is at 7.5 with a strong drop of activity at higher and lower pH values |CITS:[KOPKE90]|.</Comment>

The enzyme proved to be very labile in the absence of bovine serum albumine (BSA) which, being rich in cysteine residues, serves as an antioxidant stabilizing agent. Under these conditions, the enzyme was shown to have triose-phosphate isomerase activity . The activity of the enzyme is reduced to less than 20% in the presence of 2.5 mM |FRAME:OXIDIZED-GLUTATHIONE|. This inactivation is reversible by addition of |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE|. In the absence of BSA or |FRAME:DITHIOTHREITOL|, the recombinant enzyme was rapidly and irreversibly inactivated, suggesting that it is subject to spontaneous oxidation. This phenomenon is promoted by the addition of |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE| .</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">ACO2 is an aconitase that can catalyze the conversion of |FRAME: CIT| to |FRAME: THREO-DS-ISO-CITRATE| through a |FRAME: CIS-ACONITATE| intermediate, based on the phenotype of reduced aconitase activity in an &lt;i&gt;aco2&lt;/i&gt; mutant . ACO2 may participate in the TCA cycle and other primary metabolic pathways and it is believed to accumulate in the mitochondria and the cytosol . &lt;i&gt;aco2&lt;/i&gt; mutants have an elevated level of transcripts for |FRAME: AT2G28190|, which encodes a superoxide dismutase, and show enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress. Interestingly, one member of the aconitase family, |FRAME: AT4G35830-MONOMER ACO1|, was shown to specifically bind to the 5&apos; UTR of |FRAME: AT2G28190| &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; .</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">mMDH1 is one of two mitochondrial malate dehydrogenases in Arabidopsis thaliana, based on a mutant analysis that shows a 30% reduction in total leaf malate dehydrogenase activity in &lt;i&gt;mmdh1-2 &lt;/i&gt; mutants. In addition, an &lt;i&gt;mmdh1-2 mmdh2-1&lt;/i&gt; double mutant has 40% lower levels of leaf malate dehydrogenase activity suggesting that both mMDH1 and mMDH2 are active malate dehydrogenases in Arabidopsis . The larger contribution of mMDH1 to the malate dehydrogenase activity is consistent with it being the major isoform found in mitochondria according to proteomic analyses |CITS: [18385124][11743115]|. The activity of this enzyme was additionally demonstrated when reintroduction of 35S:mMDH1 into the double mutant restored whole leaf malate dehydrogenase activity . The exclusive mitochondrial localization of these two MDH family members is further supported by the observation that&lt;i&gt;mmdh1-2 mmdh2-1&lt;/i&gt; double mutants have no detectable mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase activity . They have several other abnormalities, such as slow growth, reduced mitochondrial oxidation, and reduced net carbon dioxide assimilation . Some aspects of the &lt;i&gt;mmdh1-2 mmdh2-1&lt;/i&gt; double mutant&apos;s phenotype indicate that the mMDHs in Arabidopsis may act primarily on OAA to promote malate formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</Comment>

      <Comment source="THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, tissier">Two enzymes with ATP-dependent fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase activity (PFK) resolved into distinct peaks by FPLC were isolated from clarified extracts of &lt;i&gt;Musa acuminata&lt;/i&gt; fruits (which had been treated with |FRAME:ETHYLENE-CMPD| and allowed to ripen for five days at 25°C) . The second peak named PFK II (this enzyme) was purified 344-fold to a final specific activity of 5.5 units.mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Both isoforms (PFK I and PFK II) were unstable and could not be purified beyond gel filtration FPLC. However, since the unpure preparations were devoid of contaminating activities (listed in ), the preparations were considered suitable for further kinetic characterization. No activity was detected when |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| was replaced by |FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:CPD-448| or |FRAME:FRU1P|. Positive cooperativity was demonstrated for |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|, whereas ATP binding followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics . Alternative nucleoside triphosphates can be used in place of ATP (although it is the preferred form), but, when ADP, UDP or PPi were used, no activity was detected .</Comment>

      <Comment source="THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, tissier">Two enzymes with phosphoglycomutase activity were isolated from the endosperm of &lt;i&gt;Ricinus communis&lt;/i&gt; (Castor oil plants) seeds harvested 30 to 40 days after anthesis; one plastidic, the other cytosolic. The cytosolic protein (this protein) was partially purified to a specific activity of 622.5 &amp;mu;mol.min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.mg&lt;sub&gt;protein&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; . The purified enzyme could be kept at -20°C in 10 mM K-phosphate containing 20-25% glycerol for at least one month without any loss of activity. However, at pH values lower than 6.8, activity decreases rapidly, and at pH 5.5 the enzyme is completely inactivated after 8h at 4°C. By contrast, when the enzyme is kept at pH 11.0 for 24h at 4°C, only 15% of activity is lost . A 50% decrease in activity was determined after 125 min at 50°C and 25 min at 60°C (the enzyme was not protected from inactivation by |FRAME:G3P|, |FRAME:2-PG|, |FRAME:23-DIPHOSPHOGLYCERATE| or |FRAME:Pi|). A variety of metabolic effectors (listed in ) were tested to determine their influence on the enzyme activity. None of them had any effect on the enzyme. Moreover, no divalent cations were required for activity.</Comment>

      <Comment source="THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, tissier">An enzyme with ATP:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFK) was isolated from the leaf chloroplasts of &lt;i&gt;Ricinus communis&lt;/i&gt; . The enzyme was shown to be more stable than its cytosolic counterpart (see |FRAME:MONOMER-12841|; this is in contrast to what had been observed for cucumber PFKs, where the cytosolic isoform was the more stable |CITS:[Botha88]|). 99% of the contaminating hexose phosphate isomerase activity in the preparation was removed by AMP-agarose chromatography. The enzyme exhibits hyperbolic ATP saturation kinetics at both pH 8.0 and 7.0. At pH 8.0, the enzyme is inhibited by ATP at concentrations above 5 mM, whereas, at pH 7.2, it is strongly inhibited by ATP concentrations above 0.5 mM. High concentrations of |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| relieve the ATP inhibition . Inhibition studies suggest that this enzyme is inactive during starch buildup and is activated during starch degradation.</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">ACO1 is an aconitase that can catalyze the conversion of |FRAME: CIT| to |FRAME: THREO-DS-ISO-CITRATE| through a |FRAME: CIS-ACONITATE| intermediate, based on the phenotype of reduced aconitase activity in an &lt;i&gt;aco1&lt;/i&gt; mutant . ACO1 may participate in the TCA cycle and other primary metabolic pathways and it is believed to accumulate in the mitochondria and the cytosol . Interestingly, ACO1 can specifically bind to the 5&apos; UTR of |FRAME: AT2G28190|, which encodes a superoxide dismutase, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and can affect the levels of |FRAME: AT2G28190| transcript accumulation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Either through this mechanism or other undiscovered mechanisms, ACO1 appears to play a role in the response to oxidative stress in Arabidopsis thaliana .</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, dreher">FUM2 is one of two fumarase enzymes present in |FRAME: ORG-5993 &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; col|. While |FRAME: AT2G47510-MONOMER FUM1| localizes to the mitochondria, FUM2 appears to be a cytosolic form of the enzyme . FUM2 appears to be required for the formation of fumarate from malate in Arabidopsis leaves. A role for FUM2 in nitrogen assimilation in the light is suggested by the shift from N-containing amino acids to N-free organic acids in &lt;i&gt;fum2&lt;/i&gt; mutants . However, FUM2 does not appear to be required for lipid metabolism and growth in seedlings . The phenotype of reduced |FRAME: FUM fumarate| and increased |FRAME: MAL (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-malate| in &lt;i&gt;fum2&lt;/i&gt; mutants suggests that FUM2 primarily catalyzes malate dehydration during the day, however, further enzymatic characterization will be required to establish whether FUM2 also catalyzes the reverse reaction, and, if so, under what conditions .</Comment>

      <Comment source="THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, tissier">A protein with 3-phoshoglycerate kinase activity was purified from a crude extract of spinach (&lt;i&gt;Spinacea oleracea&lt;/i&gt; L.). In fact two isoforms of the protein were identified through this procedure: one is chloroplastic (this protein), the other cytosolic (see |FRAME:MONOMER-12710|). The chloroplastic protein was also purified from isolated chloroplasts, allowing the exact determination of the identity of each crude extract-purified isoform |CITS:[kopke90]|. The chloroplastic protein has a molecular weight of 39 kDa by size exclusion chromatography (41 kDa on SDS-PAGE). The protein is monomeric. Its pH optimum is at 7.5 with a strong drop of activity at higher and lower pH values |CITS:[KOPKE90]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2&apos; position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety. These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). Most of the time they function as cosubstrates, and in some cases they function as |FRAME: Cofactors cofactors|. They are often referred to by the obsolete term &quot;coenzymes&quot;. The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form. |FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).</Comment>

      <Comment source="SRI, caspi">This class holds |FRAME: Quinones quinones| that are involved in electron transfer within membranes. Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compound, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, &quot;benzo-&quot; for benzene, &quot;naphtho-&quot; for naphthalene, and &quot;anthra-&quot; for anthracene) with a &quot;-quinone&quot; suffix. Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|. Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 &quot;vitamin K&quot;|.</Comment>

      <Comment>|FRAME: LIPOIC-ACID &quot;Lipoate&quot;| is an organosulfur compound that is used as an essential cofactor by many enzyme complexes. The functional group of lipoate is a ditholane ring, which is a cyclic disulfide. The enzyme complexes that require lipoate have a dedicated |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein &quot;lipoyl domain&quot;|, and lipoate is actually produced on this domain. The precursor |FRAME: CPD-195| molecule is first attached to a specific |FRAME: LYS| residue within the lipoyl domain (producing |FRAME: Octanoylated-domains|), and is then converted to lipoate by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.8|, resulting in |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein-N6-lipoyllysine|. |FRAME: CPLX0-782 &quot;Lipoate synthase&quot;| not only catalyzes the reaction, but is also the source of the two sulfur atoms (see several pathway variants under |FRAME: Lipoate-Biosynthesis|).</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2&apos; position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety. These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). Most of the time they function as cosubstrates, and in some cases they function as |FRAME: Cofactors cofactors|. They are often referred to by the obsolete term &quot;coenzymes&quot;. The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form. |FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">The most abundant form of the phosphate ion at pH 7.3 is hydrogenphosphate. To simplify the presentation of reactions taking place at physiological pH, MetaCyc does not distinguish between the two forms, and uses the name &quot;phosphate&quot; even though the structure shown is that of hydrogenphosphate.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: GLT| is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. It is named after wheat gluten, from which it was described in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen. |FRAME: GLT| plays an important role in nitrogen metabolism in the cell. Once cells take up ammonium, it is fixed by incorporation into the TCA cycle intermediate |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| by |FRAME: EC-1.4.1.4|, forming |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [13239305]| (an additional ammonium molecule can be fixed into L-glutamate, e.g. by |FRAME: EC-6.3.1.2|, forming |FRAME: GLN| |CITS: [14833423]|). Glutamate then becomes the central source for passing amino groups on to other molecules by the action of transaminase (=aminotransferase) enzymes, distributing nitrogen throughout the cell. For example, glutamate can transfer the amino group to the common metabolites |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, forming |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE| and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, respectively. It has been estimated that glutamate and glutamine provide 75% and 25%, respectively, of all cellular nitrogen |CITS: [30026566]|. In addition to its protein building role, |FRAME: GLT| is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system, acting on ionotropic and metabotropic (G-protein coupled) receptors |CITS: [10736372]|. |FRAME: GLT| interacts with the umami taste receptors, which sense glutamates and nucleotides, imparting &quot;meaty&quot;, &quot;savory&quot;, and &quot;broth-like&quot; flavor. The monosodium salt of glutamate (MSG), which is found naturally in some foods, is often added to foodstuff for flavoring |CITS: [1679557]|. Although MSG is commnly believed to cause headaches, all scientific studies found no such effect |CITS: [27189588]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">Quercetin is a plant flavonol that is found in many fruits, vegetables, leaves, seeds, and grains. It was first isolated from an oak tree (genus |FRAME: TAX-3511|) hence its name. Quercetin has a bitter flavor and is used as an ingredient in dietary supplements, beverages, and foods. It is one of the most abundant dietary flavonoids. The compound was shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.59| (FabZ) from the pathogenic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-210| |CITS: [18780820]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: OXALATE Oxalate| is the most oxidized two-carbon compound. It is made in high concentrations by some plants and fungi and can reach high micromolar concentrations in soil. Oxalate is toxic to mammals but is metabolized by many bacteria and plants by various pathways. In high concentrations, it causes death in humans and animals because of its corrosive effects, while smaller amounts can cause various pathological disorders, including hyperoxaluria, calcium oxalate stones, pyridoxine deficiency, and even renal failure. In oxalate-accumulating plants, calcium oxalate crystal accumulation occurs in specialized idioblast cells. The crystals are thought to deter herbivore feeding |CITS: [16514014]| and may also serve a role in regulating free calcium levels |CITS: [15862089]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">Many hundreds of enzymes require magnesium ions (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) for their catalytic action, including all enzymes using or synthesizing ATP and those that use other nucleotides to synthesize DNA and RNA. The interaction between magnesium ions and phosphate makes magnesium essential to basic nucleic acid chemistry, and the common ATP molecule is normally found in a chelate with a magnesium ion. Photosynthetic organisms require Mg for the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis. The function of magnesium in the center of the porphyrin ring in chlorophyll is similar to that of iron in the center of the porphyrin ring in heme. Mg is the fourth-most abundant element in the human body (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).</Comment>

      <Comment>Arsenic is the most prevalent environmental toxic substance. It ranks first on the priority list of Hazardous Substances published by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), based on a combination of frequency, toxicity, and potential for human exposure. It is also a Group 1 human carcinogen associated with skin, bladder and lung cancer. While arsenic exists in two oxidation states, As(III) and As(V), in aerobic environments most inorganic arsenic is found as As(V), such as arsenic acid. The prevalent form of arsenic acid under neutral pH is |FRAME: ARSENATE arsenate&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;|. At neutral pH values arsenate exists mostly in the |FRAME: ARSENATE &quot;AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;| form (pKa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;= 2:3; pKa&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 6:8; and pKa&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 11:6) |CITS: [11161507]|. |FRAME: ARSENATE Arsenate| is chemically similar to phosphate, and enters most cells via phosphate transporters. Once inside cells, arsenate is removed by assorted detoxification mechanisms, described in pathways under |FRAME: Arsenate-Detoxification|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: ASCORBATE| is oxidized in cells to |FRAME: CPD-13907 dehydroascorbate| via the radical |FRAME: CPD-318|. |FRAME: CPD-13907 Dehydroascorbate| can be recycled back to ascorbate by the |FRAME: PWY-2261|, or it can be further broken down &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by irreversible reactions. The structure shown here is the one found in most text books. However, it appears to be incorrect.

      <Comment source="BioCyc">In eukaryotes, isocitrate dehydrogenase exists in two forms: an NAD(+)-linked enzyme (EC 1.1.1.41), which is found only in mitochondria and displaying allosteric properties, and a non-allosteric, NADP(+)-linked enzyme (EC 1.1.1.42) that is found in both mitochondria and cytoplasm. The NADP-dependent enzyme from some species can also use NAD(+), but much more slowly. Unlike EC 1.1.1.42, The NAD-dependent enzyme can not use oxalosuccinate as an alternative substrate.</Comment>

      <Comment source="BioCyc">A multimer (24-mer or 60-mer, depending on the source) of this enzyme forms the core of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex, and binds tightly both EC 1.2.4.1 and EC 1.8.1.4. The lipoyl group of this enzyme is reductively acetylated by EC 1.2.4.1, and the only observed direction catalyzed by EC 2.3.1.12 is that where the acetyl group is passed to coenzyme A.</Comment>

      <Comment>Pyruvate kinase is an important regulatory enzyme of glycolysis that catalyzes the irreversible phosphorylation of ADP at the expense of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), yielding pyruvate and ATP. Although pyruvate kinase is located in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells, it is also known to exist in the plastids of vascular plants and green algae. In plants, pyruvate kinase is thought to be a primary regulator of glycotytic flux to pyruvate. The cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PK&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) purified from &lt;i&gt;Brassica napus&lt;/i&gt; has a specific activity of 51 &amp;mu;mol PEP utilized/min/mg protein . This homotetrameric protein exhibits a broad pH profile centered at about 6.8 although increased catalytic efficiency for PEP and inhibitor sensitivity is reported at pH 7.4. It also displays an absolute dependence for both K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and a nonabsolute specificity for ADP, with good use of alternative purine and pyrimidine nucleotide diphosphates (particularly UDP). Notably, L-glutamate is an effective inhibitor whilst L-aspartate acts as activator for PK&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. Oxalate, which shares a close structural similarity with the enolate form of pyruvate, was also shown to act as potent inhibitor of PK&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; .</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, zhang">The Arabidopsis genome has 14 predicted pyruvate kinase genes. Three were experimentally shown located in the chloroplast and have pyruvate enzyme activities. One encodes the alpha subunit (PKp1, or PKp-alpha), two for the beta subunit (PKp2 and PKp3, or PKp-beta1 and PKp-beta2, respectively). The native enzyme is a hetero-octamer, in a composition of 4alpha4beta. Both alpha and beta subunits are required for enzyme activity. The alphabeta1 composition is more active. Its Vmax is 2-fold higher than that of the alphabeta2 enzyme. The alphabeta1 enzyme also has a lower Km for PEP and ADP, lower sensitivity to activator and inhibitor, and ability to use other NDPs more efficiently. The alphabeta2 enzyme is less active and more susceptible to metabolite-state regulation. It is not clear of what special roles the alphabeta2 enzyme plays.</Comment>

      <Comment>This enzyme was partially purified from both leaves and endosperm of wheat and the gene encoding the purified protein was cloned . The enzyme is thought to be homotetrameric and to be phosphorylated, presumably in a light-dependent manner. The phosphorylation was also shown to be tissue-dependent. Partially purified proteins catalyze the irreversible oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate into 3-phosphoglycerate coupled to NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.</Comment>

      <Comment>Pyruvate kinase is an important regulatory enzyme of glycolysis that catalyzes the irreversible phosphorylation of ADP at the expense of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), yielding pyruvate and ATP. Although pyruvate kinase is located in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells, it is also known to exist in the plastids of vascular plants and green algae. In plants, pyruvate kinase is thought to be a primary regulator of glycotytic flux to pyruvate. The plastidic (leucoplast) pyruvate kinase purified from &lt;i&gt;Brassica napus&lt;/i&gt; has a specific activity of 28 &amp;mu;mol PEP utilized/min/mg protein . This heterohexameric (&amp;alpha; and &amp;beta; subunits) protein has the interesting kinetic feature of being activated by 6-P gluconate, the product of the first committed step of the oxidative pentose-P pathway, an essential generator of reducing power (NADPH).</Comment>

However, activity is higher in the presence of NADP . The protein is redoc insensitive when treated with thioredoxins but was found to be inactivated by |FRAME:OXIDIZED-DITHIOTHREITOL| and other oxidants, including |FRAME:HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|. This inactivation could not be reverted with reductants and depends on the irreversible oxidation of Cys-149.

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1">The mitochondrially-localized NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is a heteromeric complex in all species studied to date including yeast (&lt;i&gt;S.cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;), cows, pigs, tobacco &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana tabacum&lt;/i&gt;, and Arabidopsis, though the subunit composition and stoichiometry of the complexes seem to differ between species |CITS: [2198251][16527867][7287723][4319243][9881153]|. The Arabidopsis complex appears to be similar to the yeast complex composed of IDH1 and IDH2 where one catalytic and one regulatory are required for activity |CITS: [2198251][16527867][9881153]|. Arabidopsis has three regulatory subunits (|FRAME: AT4G35260|, |FRAME: AT2G17130|, and |FRAME: AT4G35650|) plus two catalytic subunits (|FRAME: AT5G03290| and |FRAME: AT3G09810|). Any of the six potential dimeric combinations of a regulatory and catalytic subunit can functionally complement the yeast &lt;i&gt;idh1 idh2&lt;/i&gt; double mutant, whereas none of the subunits alone have been shown to complement the double mutant . The representative |FRAME: AT2G17130| / |FRAME: AT5G03290| complex shown here contains two of the best-characterized subunits. The exact stoichiometry of the subunits in the complex is unknown and it remains possible that multimeric complexes containing one or more different catalytic and regulatory subunits together may also form &lt;i&gt;in planta&lt;/i&gt; as suggested for tobacco |CITS: [16527867][9881153]|. This enzyme complex is believed to function in the |FRAME: PWY-5690 TCA cycle| and may participate in nitrogen assimilation pathways as well |CITS: [16527867][17468208]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1">In mitochondria, succinate is oxidized by the membrane-bound enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (complex II). This enzyme complex is composed of flavin adenine dinucleotide and iron-sulfur proteins. This complex which is not involved in the translocation of protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, ultimately reduces ubiquinone into ubiquinol. The complex contains two major subcomplexes, the larger, water-soluble, complex contains two subunits: Fp and Ip. The Fp (flavor-iron-sulfur protein) subunit covalently binds FAD and has two iron-sulfur proteins of 2Fe-2S configuration called S1 and S2. The Ip subunit contains an iron-sulfur protein of 4Fe-4S configuration called S3. The other subcomplex is hydrophobic and consists of two small polypeptides. Electrons are transferred from FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through S1, S2, S3 to ubiquinone. Complex II is tightly regulated and exists as an inactive form stabilized by binding of oxaloacetate. Incubation with either ATP or ubiquinol activates the enzyme. The inhibitor-binding site as well as the catalytic active site (succinate dehydrogenation) is contained in the larger subcomplex.</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, THE-ARABIDOPSIS-INFORMATION-RESOURCE, zhang">The Arabidopsis genome has 14 predicted pyruvate kinase genes. Three were experimentally shown located in the chloroplast and have pyruvate enzyme activities. One encodes the alpha subunit (PKp1, or PKp-alpha), two for the beta subunit (PKp2 and PKp3, or PKp-beta1 and PKp-beta2, respectively). The native enzyme is a hetero-octamer, in a composition of 4alpha4beta. Both alpha and beta subunits are required for enzyme activity. The alphabeta1 composition is more active. Its Vmax is 2-fold higher than that of the alphabeta2 enzyme. The alphabeta1 enzyme also has a lower Km for PEP and ADP, lower sensitivity to activator and inhibitor, and ability to use other NDPs more efficiently. The alphabeta2 enzyme is less active and more susceptible to metabolite-state regulation. It is not clear of what special roles the alphabeta2 enzyme plays.</Comment>
