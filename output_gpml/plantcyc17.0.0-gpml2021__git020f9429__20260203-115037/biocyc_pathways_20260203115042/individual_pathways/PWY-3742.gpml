  <Description>&lt;b&gt;General information&lt;/b&gt;: Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are vital cofactors for enzymes mediating one-carbon-transfer reactions |CITS: [9190084]| |CITS: [10785666]|. Folates are involved in a wide range of key metabolic functions including the biosynthesis of methionine, purines, thymidylate and panthotenate. In plants folates are also involved in photorespiration, amino acid metabolism and chloroplastic protein biosynthesis |CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [12644692]|. The fluxes through C1 pathways mediated by folates are especially high for methylated compounds such as the secondary metabolites lignin, alkaloids and betaines and for primary metabolites such as choline, pectine and chlorophyll |CITS: [11337394]|. Although the biosynthetic steps in microbial folate biosynthesis essentially mirror the plant variant several differences are noteworthy. In contrast to the bacteria pathway (|FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) which predominantly takes place in the cytosol, the plant variant of tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis is split between three subcellular compartments |CITS: [11960743]|. Several plant enzymes involved in the tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis differ from their microbial counterparts with regard to functionality, regulation and composition |CITS: [9190084]| |CITS: [14745019]| |CITS: [15500462]|. Plants prefer the polyglutamylated forms of folates (compare |FRAME:PWY-2161|, |FRAME: PWY-2161B-PMN|) since the turnover rate of those compounds is markedly increased |CITS: [9190084]| |CITS: [SCOTT00]| |CITS: [KIRK94]|and meets the high demands for folates as observed in plants |CITS: [11960743]|. In addition the conjugated forms of folate facilitate the retention of the vitamin within the cell and its subcellular compartments |CITS: [1916088]|. Bacteria, fungi, and plants synthesize folates &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;, but humans are unable to synthesize folate and need a dietary supply. Lack of folate is the most serious vitamin deficiency decease for humans and results in reduced DNA synthesis and cell division rate. Folates are, to a varying degree, all unstable, due to the oxidative cleavage into pteridine and pPABA glutamate moieties which is additionally promoted by light. The high demand for folate in fundamental metabolic processes and their chemical susceptibility to oxygen and light may be part of the difficulties to prevent folate deficiency even in highly developed countries and has aroused intensive research to genetically engineer the folate biosynthetic pathway |CITS:[SCOTT00]|. &lt;b&gt;Special information&lt;/b&gt;: Folates are tripartite molecules and are made up of pterin, p-aminobenzoate (pABA) and glutamate moieties. In plants the pterin moiety is formed from GTP in the cytosol, which couples to pABA (synthesized in plastids) in mitochondria followed by subsequent glutamylation and reduction steps which may take place in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids |CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [11752472]|. The one-carbon units are either attached to the N-5 of the pterin moiety, to the N-10 of the pAPA moiety or are brigded in between those two (e.g. 5,10-methenyl or methylene-THF) |CITS: [BASSET05]|. Increased efforts in research to unravel the plant folate biosynthesis have recently resulted in the cloning of the missing plant enzymes - aminodeoxychorismate synthase (ADCS) |CITS: [14745019]|, aminodeoxychorismate lyase (ADC lyase) |CITS: [15500462]| and dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHN aldolase) |CITS: [15107504]| |CITS: [15165863]|completing the enzymatic steps in folate biosynthesis. In the pABA branch a reaction unique to plants has been identified, which reversibly converts pABA to its glucose ester by a cytosolic glucosyltransferase. It has been shown that most of the pAPA in plants exists as glucose ester. Although the physiological function of this reaction remains to be elucidated the glucose ester was proposed to be involved in storage and transportation processes of pAPA |CITS: [12668665]|. The complete set of folate enzymes is only present in mitochondria. However, the recent discovery that folylpolyglutamate synthases are present in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids with each of them encoded by a different gene in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [11752472]| points to the fact that at least parts of the pathway can be carried out independently in those compartments. Interestingly, the enzyme hydrolyzing the polyglutamylated folates (&amp;gamma;-glutamyl hydrolase) has been found to be an extracellular enzyme in plants |CITS: [8912628]|. Consequently, the transport and exact conversion of folates and their derivatives within the different cell compartments and their regulation pattern remains to be clarified before successfully attempting the endeavor to genetically engineer this pathway.</Description>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">The protein sequence of the pABA synthase (PabA and PabB subunits) of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; was used to isolate the cDNA encoding the aminodeoxychorismate synthase (ADCS) in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. The enzyme was recombinant expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; demonstrating the formation of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate. Furthermore, the functional complementation of an &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; double mutant and a yeast pABA synthase deletant confirmed that the cDNA indeed encoded for a functional enzyme. The recombinant protein overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; showed no ADC lyase activity indicating that the second step towards pABA must be catalyzed by a different enzyme in plants. The monomeric protein is bipartite containing tandem domains homologous to the PabA and PabB subunits of the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; enzyme. No feedback inhibition of the enzyme was observed for neither pABA or folate which is in contrast to a closely related enzyme, anthranilate synthase .</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">The cDNA encoding a cytosolic form of the bifunctional hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase/ dihydropteroate synthase (HPPK/DHPS) has been identified and characterized in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. The enzyme catalyzes two consecutive steps in the tetrahydrofolate biosynthetic pathway, i.e. the diphosphorylation of dihyropterin (HPPK activity) and the following incorporation of p-aminobenzoate (pABA) to finally form dihydropteroate (DHPS avtivity). The molecular function was confirmed by two lines of evidence, first the functional complementation of a yeast mutant and second by characterizing the recombinant protein expressed in and obtained from &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. This enzyme is located at a branchpoint of the tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis, therefore considered to have regulating impact on the pathway. The exclusive expression of the enzyme in the developing inflorescence indicates a function in sustaining the high rate of DNA synthesis during this process to boost folate supplies. In addition, a function related to oxidative stress has been proposed due to the decreased germination rate in the corresponding knock-out mutant seed during development. However, the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; function of the enzyme remains elusive as its mitochondrial counterpart (mitHPPK/DHPS - At4g3000) is considered to be sufficient to contribute to the folate biosynthesis. Therefore, the cytHPPK/DHPS is considered a unique feature in Arabidopsis probably created by a relatively recent gene duplication .</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">The spinach 10-formyl-THF synthetase sequence  was used to screen the Arabidopsis dbEST to select an N-terminal sequence homolog to the spinach sequence. Finally a cDNA was isolated containing an amino acid sequence conserved in other 10-formyl-THF synthetases |CITS: [Skavdahl99]|. Unlike in other eukaryotes, where a trifunctional enzyme (C1-THF-synthase) converts 10-formyl-THF to 5,10-methylene-THF, plants have been shown to possess a monofunctional 10-formyl-THF synthetase. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the C1-THF synthase/SHMT pathway (which includes the 10-formyl-THF synthetase) in Arabidopsis can compensate for deficiency of serine when the primary glycine decarboxylase complex/serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GDC/SHMT) pathway is disturbed . The 10-formyl-THF synthetase isolated from pea exhibited a strong preference for polyglutamylated substrates. The affinity increased significantly from mono (Km = 40 uM) to pentaglutamylated THF (Km = 3 uM) |CITS: [Kirk94]|.</Comment>

      <Comment>The dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHNA) was isolated from a tomato cDNA using a full-length potato EST for reverse transcription PCR. The obtained cDNA was recombinant expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and was able to carry out both the aldol and epimerization reaction on dihydroneopterin. The enzyme forms a D(4)-symmetric homooctamer and is related to substructures of dihydroneopterin triphosphate epimerase . Although the physiological role of the epimerization reaction remains to be solved it was proposed that the formation of tetrahydromonapterin derived from the epimerization activity may substitute for the missing plant cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, necessary for the function of certain hydroxylases and NO synthase .</Comment>

Although it was originally thought to act as an |FRAME: RXN0-1441 &quot;NADH pyrophosphatase&quot;| based on assays performed in the presence of 5 mM |FRAME: MN+2 Mn&lt;SUP&gt;2+&lt;/SUP&gt;|, subsequent analyses executed in the presence of |FRAME: MG+2 Mg&lt;SUP&gt;2+&lt;/SUP&gt;| indicate that &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; this enzyme is may be bi-functional and active against 8-oxo-(d)GTP and dihydroneopterin triphosphate |CITS: [15878881][17804481][15611104]|. 8-oxo-(d)GTP can be formed spontaneously in the cell by reactive oxygen species. It can then be mis-incorporated into DNA or RNA and cause errors in DNA replication and transcription. Organisms, from bacteria to humans, therefore have enzymes like NUDX1 that can cleave the diphosphate group from these oxidized nucleotides and prevent them from being added to nascent DNA and RNA strands . NUDX1 also has similarity to a bacterial enzyme involved in folate synthase that acts on DHNTP. NUDX1 can catalyze the formation of DHNP from this compound, but kinetic analyses of the enzyme demonstrate that it prefers 8-oxo-(d)GTP and other nucleoside triphosphates to NUDX1 may form a dimer under native conditions . It has a k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; / K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; .</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, pmngroup">The Arabidopsis genome was searched for sequences similar to dihydrofolate synthetase/folylpolyglutamate synthetase (DHFS/FPGS) signatures and four cDNA&apos;s were retrieved. The molecular functions of the cDNA&apos;s were tested by functional complementing mutant yeasts defect in either DHFS or FPGS activity. Protein extracts from the complemented yeast were used to confirm the specific function of the enzyme in vitro. Three cDNA&apos;s encoded for folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity (FPGS) but did not exhibit any dihydrofolate synthetase activity (DHFS). Interestingly, in contrast to any other FPGS analyzed in other organisms, Arabidopsis has a set of FPGS&apos;s, which not only have different subcellular locations but are encoded by three different genes. One of them, named AtDFB (At5g05980), encoded for the FPGS located in the stroma of chloroplasts catalyzing the addition of glutamyl residues to the different tetrafolate derivatives. The fact that each compartment of the cell possesses its own, probably transcriptional regulated FPGS supports the view that the unconjugated form of tetrahydrofolate (THF) may represent the transport form of THF which has to be distributed between mitochondria (origin of THF), cytosol and chloroplasts. The FPGS in generating the polyglutamylated isoforms prevent the transport of those different derivatives and process their cell-compartment-dependent biosynthesis .</Comment>

      <Comment source="O-28, pujar">Genetic approaches were used to isolate the cDNA encoding the aminodeoxychorismate synthase (ADCS) in |FRAME:TAX-4081 &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;|. The enzyme was recombinant expressed in |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| demonstrating the formation of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate. Furthermore, the functional complementation of an |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| double mutant and a yeast pABA synthase deletant confirmed that the cDNA indeed encoded for a functional enzyme. The monomeric protein is bipartite containing tandem domains homologous to the PabA and PabB subunits of the |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| enzyme. No feedback inhibition of the enzyme was observed for neither pABA or folate which is in contrast to a closely related enzyme, anthranilate synthase . The expression patterns of ADCS during the ripening process of fruits suggest that fruits synthesize their own supply of folate precursors, which is in agreement with the expression pattern of other enzymes from the pterin branch in ripening fruits .</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: GLT| is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. It is named after wheat gluten, from which it was described in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen. |FRAME: GLT| plays an important role in nitrogen metabolism in the cell. Once cells take up ammonium, it is fixed by incorporation into the TCA cycle intermediate |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| by |FRAME: EC-1.4.1.4|, forming |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [13239305]| (an additional ammonium molecule can be fixed into L-glutamate, e.g. by |FRAME: EC-6.3.1.2|, forming |FRAME: GLN| |CITS: [14833423]|). Glutamate then becomes the central source for passing amino groups on to other molecules by the action of transaminase (=aminotransferase) enzymes, distributing nitrogen throughout the cell. For example, glutamate can transfer the amino group to the common metabolites |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, forming |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE| and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, respectively. It has been estimated that glutamate and glutamine provide 75% and 25%, respectively, of all cellular nitrogen |CITS: [30026566]|. In addition to its protein building role, |FRAME: GLT| is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system, acting on ionotropic and metabotropic (G-protein coupled) receptors |CITS: [10736372]|. |FRAME: GLT| interacts with the umami taste receptors, which sense glutamates and nucleotides, imparting &quot;meaty&quot;, &quot;savory&quot;, and &quot;broth-like&quot; flavor. The monosodium salt of glutamate (MSG), which is found naturally in some foods, is often added to foodstuff for flavoring |CITS: [1679557]|. Although MSG is commnly believed to cause headaches, all scientific studies found no such effect |CITS: [27189588]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2&apos; position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety. These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). Most of the time they function as cosubstrates, and in some cases they function as |FRAME: Cofactors cofactors|. They are often referred to by the obsolete term &quot;coenzymes&quot;. The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form. |FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).</Comment>

      <Comment source="AUN7V-2">|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides. During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|. Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&amp;gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &amp;gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &amp;alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds. The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives. The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|. This class stands for 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">|FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2&apos; position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety. These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). Most of the time they function as cosubstrates, and in some cases they function as |FRAME: Cofactors cofactors|. They are often referred to by the obsolete term &quot;coenzymes&quot;. The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form. |FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).</Comment>

      <Comment>|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides. During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|. Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&amp;gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &amp;gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &amp;alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds. The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives. The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|. This class stands for 10-formyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">Formate is a one-carbon molecule that was first isolated from distillation of ant bodies, and it was subsequently named using the Latin word for ant, formica |CITS: [Stumper21]|. Ants and other insects accumulate formate in secretory glands and release their content as a mechanism of defense. Formate serves as an intermediate in one-carbon (1C) metabolism in all organisms. It is also a key metabolite for many bacterial and archaeal species. Depending on the physiological conditions, formate serves various roles, such as to act as a reductant in anaerobic respiration, be oxidized aerobically, be secreted, or be converted to hydrogen and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Formate is particularly common in anaerobic habitats, produced as a fermentation product of some species and used as a growth substrate for others. It is crucial compound in many syntrophic associations, in which organisms live close to the thermodynamic limit (for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens) |CITS: [18708519][20844539]|. Its redox potential is low (around -420 mV), which allows it to donate an electron for the reduction of fumarate. In eukaryotes formate is produced from a variety of nutrients, and can be fed into a number of biosynthetic pathways. A common source of formate is the catabolism of serine or glycine (via tetrahydrofolate). Another important source is formaldehyde, which is formed by many demethylation enzymes and as a degradation product of methanol. Formate is also produced during sterol synthesis, polyamine synthesis, and tryptophan degradation, and is used during purine synthesis, thymidylate synthesis, and as the source of carbon for methylation reactions via folate and methionine (formate can be assimilated into folate by |FRAME: EC-6.3.4.3| and its carbon transferred to methionine by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13|. Methionine is then converted to |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|, the most common methyl group donor) |CITS: [31402327]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue, SRI, caspi">UDP-glucose is an activated form of glucose that participates in a variety of enzymatic reactions, including: 1. Biosynthesis of glucose-containing compounds, such as polysaccharaides (glycogen, starch, laminarin and cellulose), disaccharides (sucrose, trehalose), &amp;beta;-glucosides, and glucosyl-ceramides. 2. Channeling galactose into the glycolytic pathway It has also been suggested that UDP-D-glucose can act as an extracellular signaling molecule |CITS: [12695547]|.</Comment>

      <Comment>|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides. During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|. Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&amp;gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &amp;gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &amp;alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds. The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives. The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|. This class stands for tetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">The most abundant form of the phosphate ion at pH 7.3 is hydrogenphosphate. To simplify the presentation of reactions taking place at physiological pH, MetaCyc does not distinguish between the two forms, and uses the name &quot;phosphate&quot; even though the structure shown is that of hydrogenphosphate.</Comment>

      <Comment>Methotrexate is a chemotherapy agent and immune-system suppressant used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, ectopic pregnancy, and for medical abortions. In 2017, it was the 117th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than six million prescriptions. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits |FRAME: EC-1.5.1.3|, and thus interferes with DNA synthesis |CITS: [12359872]|. As for its action as an immune-system suppressant, several other mechanisms have been suggested |CITS: [15194170][18045808]|.</Comment>

      <Comment source="xue">Many hundreds of enzymes require magnesium ions (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) for their catalytic action, including all enzymes using or synthesizing ATP and those that use other nucleotides to synthesize DNA and RNA. The interaction between magnesium ions and phosphate makes magnesium essential to basic nucleic acid chemistry, and the common ATP molecule is normally found in a chelate with a magnesium ion. Photosynthetic organisms require Mg for the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis. The function of magnesium in the center of the porphyrin ring in chlorophyll is similar to that of iron in the center of the porphyrin ring in heme. Mg is the fourth-most abundant element in the human body (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).</Comment>

      <Comment source="BioCyc">The enzymes from different sources (particularly eukaryotes versus prokaryotes) have different substrate specificities with regard to one-carbon substituents and the number of glutamate residues present on the tetrahydrofolates. In some bacteria, a single protein catalyses both this activity and that of EC 6.3.2.12, dihydrofolate synthase |CITS: [2985605]|, the combined activity of which leads to the formation of the coenzyme polyglutamated tetrahydropteroate (H4PteGlun), i.e. various tetrahydrofolates (H4folate). In contrast, the activities are located on separate proteins in most eukaryotes studied to date |CITS: [11752472]|. In |FRAME: ORG-5993|, this enzyme is present as distinct isoforms in the mitochondria, the cytosol and the chloroplast. Each isoform is encoded by a separate gene, a situation that is unique among eukaryotes |CITS: [11752472]|. As the affinity of folate-dependent enzymes increases markedly with the number of glutamic residues, the tetrahydropteroyl polyglutamates are the preferred coenzymes of C1 metabolism. (reviewed in |CITS: [9190084]|).

      <Comment source="BioCyc">The enzyme is composed of two parts, PabA and PabB. The enzyme is composed of two parts, PabA and PabB. In the absence of PabA and glutamine, PabB converts ammonia and chorismate into 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (in the presence of Mg2+). PabA converts glutamine into glutamate only in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of PabB. This enzyme is coupled with EC 4.1.3.38, aminodeoxychorismate lyase, to form 4-aminobenzoate.</Comment>

      <Comment>The spinach 10-formyl-THF synthetase was isolated to apparent homogeneity from |FRAME:TAX-3562 &lt;i&gt;Spinacia oleracea&lt;/i&gt;| leaves. Antibodies raised against the purified enzyme confirmed that the 10-formyl-THF synthetase in spinach is monofunctional, which is different from the trifunctional enzyme found in other eukaryotes. Applying those antibodies against the co-eluting enzymes (synthetase, dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase) resulted in the exclusive immuno-inactivation and immuno-precipitation of the 10-formyl-THF synthetase, whereas the other two enzyme activities were not affected at all. For maximum enzyme activity both mono and divalent cations were required and the optimal pH was determined between 7.5 and 8.5 . The cDNA encoding the spinach leaf 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase was isolated using the 10-formyl-THF synthetase specific antibodies and compared to other THF synthetases of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin. The monofunctional spinach synthetase was longer than the two other monofunctional prokaryotic proteins and it was proposed that the additional amino acids might be involved in the effective binding of higher polyglutamylated THF derivatives &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; .</Comment>

      <Comment>The bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)/thymidylate synthase (TS) was purified to apparent homogeneity from pea mitochondria, which appears to be the major subcellular location for this enzyme. The TS-catalyzed reaction produces dihydrofolate, which is the immediate substrate for the DHFR. The polypeptide consists of two domains, one harboring the DHFR activity and the other one containing the TS activity. The spatial distinction has been proved using DHFR and TS specific inhibitors which did not affect the complementary enzyme activity. The DHFR expressed almost the same activity for both mono- and pentaglutamylated substrates. In contrast, TS affinity improved significantly with the increasing number of glutamate residues attached to the substrate . The cDNA encoding the enzyme has been isolated and sequenced (see UniProt entry &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8L6F0&quot;&gt;Q8L6F0&lt;/A&gt;).</Comment>

      <Comment source="AU4FS-1, PMN, dreher">The dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHNA) gene from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; was located in the genome based on sequence similarity to a bacterial DHNA. The FOLB1 gene was expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity and crystallized to characterize its three-dimensional structure. The structural features revealed differences in both the reaction mechanism and overall fold of the enzyme indicating that the DHNA of Arabidopsis represents a new class of aldolases. The enzyme forms a D(4)-symmetric homooctamer and is related to substructures of dihydroneopterin triphosphate epimerase  which sheds light on the cleavage and epimerization activities of this enzyme . &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments reveal that this protein, and the related FOLB2 protein (At5g62980), can both act as aldolases and epimerases using both DHN and DHM as substrates . The biological significance of DHM is less well-known, however, monapterin, the oxadized form of DHM has been detected in various plant tissues (see ).</Comment>

      <Comment source="O-28, pujar">Screening tomato ESTs using the Arabidopsis aminodeoxychorismate lyase (ADCL) sequence resulted in the isolation of a cDNA encoding the ADCL in |FRAME:TAX-4081 &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;|. The functional complementation of an |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| mutant lacking ADClyase activity confirmed that the cDNA indeed encoded for a functional enzyme . The complemented enzyme was recombinantly expressed in |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| bearing the ADC synthase gene  demonstrating in this coupled assay the formation of p-aminobenzoate (pABA). The enzyme was overexpressed in |FRAME:TAX-562 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;| and the partially purified recombinant protein was determined as a dimeric protein with a molecular weight of 63 +/- 8 kDa. The protein was not inhibited by physiological concentrations of folates, pABA, or pABA glucose ester. The expression patterns of tomato ADCL during the ripening process of fruits follow the expression pattern of the ADC synthase in ripening fruits  indicating that the formation of pABA may be not regulated at the metabolic but rather at the post-transcriptional level.</Comment>
